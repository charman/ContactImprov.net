There is now a Contact Improvisation jam in Buffalo, which is being
coordinated by Nancy Hughes and Janet Werther.  The jam is scheduled
for the 1st and 3rd Sundays of every month, from 5-8pm.  For now,
there will be a "class" for the first 30 minutes or so.

The jam is held at:

  The Verve, 910 Main Street, Buffalo, NY 14202 USA
