We're sending you this email because you previously submitted a request
to create or update a listing on ContactImprov.net.  Responsibility 
for the site changed hands a few weeks ago, and we are working hard on
rejuvenating this resource for the community.

It is now easier to add or update listings on the site.  Just request
an account by filling out the form on this page:

  http://www.contactimprov.net/user/request_account

We'll create an account for you in less than 48 hours.  Once you have
an account, you will be able to add listings to the site and update 
your listings on the site without having to wait for any further approval.

Because much of the contact information on the site is out of date, 
we are asking everyone to PLEASE RESUBMIT YOUR LISTING.  All old 
listings WILL BE DELETED from the site in the next few months.


We'll be adding more features to the site over the coming weeks and
months, including Google Maps support and the ability to search for
listings within a certain distance of an address.

We will never charge you for any services that ContactImprov.net 
provides.  The site is a labor of love for the community, not a 
business.

Please let us know if you have any questions about the site or
suggestions for improving it.
