The Improvisation Intensive will focus on Contact Improvisation/Release Technique, and Viewpoints composition. Homemade food will nourish our minds and bodies and each evening will end with a jam with barn doors flung wide open for all the animals to watch. In the workshop, we will examine how to find and connect to the deep well of our own personal imagery, seeking clarity in action from stillness. We will access playful self-exploration as a source of inspiration and examine the multiple layers of our internal landscape through active reflection. In contact, we will focus attention on the details of sensation and work on skills of receptivity and responsiveness. We will seek to bring the authentic internal impulse to expression through conscious choice-making, awakening our dancing, opening our aesthetic palette and finding new sources from within ourselves from which we can draw.<br>					<br>					Cost: $465 (includes food, lodging and class fee). Deposit: $100 deposit due by July 3rd. Travel: Schellsburg is location five hours from NYC, three hours from both Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia and 2 hours from Pittsburgh.
