Movement can be fast and dynamic or softer and more subtle. In this workshop we will roll, spiral, spring, support and fall, learning how to do so safely in relation to the ground and to each other. It is suitable for anyone who likes to move, and can be equally accessible and challenging to those with no previous movement experience, as it can to the experienced dancer. It is a dancing form of clowning, encouraging sensitivity, playfulness and presence. Matilda Leyser has been practising Contact Improvisation for many years and its principals inform all her other work, as a dancer, aerialist and physical theatre performer and teacher. These diverse disciplines in turn influence her Contact teaching, to create a playful, dynamic but gentle approach.</span><span class="fee">Fees: £50 (£25 Concession) To reserve your place on the workshop, please send a short letter, outlining your interest and experience, also enclosing full workshop fee, to CPR.

We will examine the physical actualities of touch, manipulation, counterbalance, force, resistance, and surrender, both as physical states and as metaphors for interpersonal and intercultural relations.

The base of the workshop will be a very physical approach to contact improvisation emphasizing ideas of release and efficiency. We develop a sense of soft power and lightness, bringing to the dance more articulation, presence and 3-dimensional dynamism. We work off-balance, through spirals, and in and out of inversions in weighted contact that allows us to challenge our artful presence in the unknown of mutual surrender and direction. We work with the flow of momentum, rather than attempting to muscle our way through the dance, and we look at this idea of the flow of momentum in the fine details of spilt second awareness, cultivating a calm presence in motion. A central part of Karlís study of release-work in contact is the idea of passive sequencing, where we allow momentum to enter and pass through the body and between bodies, unhindered by subtle, fear-based reaction patterns. By the inhibition of these fear responses, we cultivate a finer grade of awareness in the dance which allows for more sophistication, inner sensuality, and power. This physical study will be approached through specific vocabulary, isolated principles, and open dancing to integrate. &gt;From this base in the physical, weíll make side trips into the psychological and theatrical sides of Karlís recent performance work, both participatory and for the stage. We play as artful mammals. This workshop is intended for people with previous exposure to CI, who have a desire to be challenged in a serious study of contact, whether their practice be experiential or performative. Mind work, body work, heart work, and a fair bit of sweat. Venue: Moving East Centre for Dance, Martial Arts &amp; Complementary Medicine, St Matthias Church Hall, Wordsworth Road, London, N16 8DD, UK Times: 10.00 - 17.00 (Mon - Fri) Biography -- Karl Frost has been practicing and performing contact improvisation and interdisciplinary, dance-based performance since the mid 80's. His physical work is influenced on the one hand by Alexander and release techniques and on the other by his study of martial arts. He is known internationally for his dynamic movement style and for the edge-pushing nature of his work, both in process and performance. His performance takes the body and emotionally and physically felt experience as its reference points. His work has been showcased across N and S America, Europe, Australia, and Israel. His most recent work, Axolotl, is a study in human interaction; the audience is blindfolded for two hours and invited in a very open sense to interact and explore with each other and a group of performers, kinaesthetically and psychologically. (recent shows in Seattle, Helsinki, Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem. ìextremely interestingî (The Stranger, Seattle) He is devoted to the idea that reclaiming the joy of being in the body is a necessary part of the revolution against materialism.

Our style is rigorous, experimental and alive. Investigating the body, developing dynamic presence, and supporting curiosity are hallmarks of our distinctive synthesis. Our practice draws from a variety of methods and approaches for questioning the body and embodying questions. Our curriculum melds these influences into creative work. As contemporary movement artists we combine a reverence for tradition with respect for the individual's voice. As educators we support the student's current process while presenting them tools for enriching their potential. This intensive invites you to investigate and embody your own working process, learn with a diverse group of artists, and share your experience with others.

The content of the lab will be agreed upon by the participants before arriving at Wild Meadows. Participants will propose by email focus areas for work they would like to address or share during the retreat and a schedule will be set based on the interest within the group of participants to the various subjects proposed. This will give participants the opportunity to receive a plurality of positions and subject material using a group investigative approach. Wild Meadows, surrounded by 200 acres of secluded mountains ranges, and fertile valleys near the Allegheny mountains, is the ideal location for reflective thought and investigation into the Contact Improvisation practice and art form. Some previous experience is requested as this will result in the greatest exploration potential as an ensemble. Break periods will be scheduled to enable participants to take in the glorious natural surrounding of the farm and its cultural heritage. The area is home to Amish, Mennonites and Quakers. Also nearby are Architect, Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Waters built with a creek running under it. Food is included in the cost and will be communally prepared. Each participant will be requested to assist in the preparation of 2-3 lunch/dinner meals (with workstudy assistance) during the week-long retreat. The retreat will be facilitated by Cyrus Khambatta and other improvisers who will attend the retreat. Cyrus will provide one of the break-out sessions scheduled during the week along with the other participants.</span><br />						<span class='fee'>COST: $225 includes everything except travel DEPOSIT: ($75 deposit due by July 1st) DISCOUNT: $200 if full amount paid before July 1.

Impulses will be explored from alignment, movement flow, breath, the relationship to the space and to the other participants. After they have achieved this understanding, Hernandez leads the dancers into improvisation and composition through which they can explore and build on their own abilities as spontaneous agents and performers in relationship to their specific problems, situations, and issues. David Hernandez came to Europe with Meg Stuart and Damaged Goods in 1993. He has worked as a dancer, created his own solos, choreographed for international companies, and given workshops in Europe, the USA, and Australia. He founded and served as artistic director of the Performance Education Program in Leuven. Blueprint, a piece of him which premiered in Brussels in 2001, was chosen as one of that yearís ten best performances. (Classes will be taught in English). Gustavo Miranda (BRA) Capoeira (amateurs and professionals): In his workshop, Gustavo Miranda works with a technique of teaching and exercising that was specially designed for dancers and that he developed in connection with his contemporary dance training. This technique is strongly influenced by spiraling movements, work with the floor, constant interaction with a partner, and learning to play traditional accompanying instruments. People who learn capoeira acquire more strength and musicality, an enhanced feeling for impulse and swing, as well as the heightened awareness that comes with learning a martial art: all these attributes can be very advantageous for dancers. As a youth and young adult, Gustavo Miranda devoted much of his time to training with various capoeira groups in Rio de Janeiro, where he studied under numerous ìmestresî and under many ìprofessoresî. He achieved the rank of ìprofessorî in the well-known ABADA group in 1991. He maintains a vital connection between this interest and his work as a contemporary dancer, actor, and teacher. He currently lives in Belgium and has worked with groups such as Charleroi-Danses, The Royal Flemish Theatre, Les Ballets C. de la B., etc. (Classes will be taught in English). Thomas McManus (USA) Figuring It Out (amateurs and professionals): Dancers in the professional class will learn solos and duets from Forsytheís ballet Limbís Theorem (Enemy in the Figure). This ballet, more than any other in Forsytheís repertoire, is a test of physical and mental stamina. The choreography demands split-second timing and decision-making to allow the dancers to bring it off smoothly in the face of a crashing, blasting musical score by Thom Willems. Amateur dancers with some previous training will be offered a workshop around the theme of another Forsythe piece called Hypothetical Stream. The dancers will learn basic skills in figurative improvisation, drawing lines with the body. The movements correlate with and are inspired by the drawings of Tiepolo. Remembering both intended and unintentional movements, the dancers will create their own solos and group material to work on and present it at the end of the workshop. Thomas McManus, a former dancer with the Frankfurt Ballet, is currently rehearsing Forsytheís pieces with internationally renowned companies. Besides working as a freelance choreographer, McManus teaches workshops in improvisation throughout Europe. (The course will be taught in German and English). Joao Fiadeiro (P)Critical Zone ñ An Introduction to Real-Time Composition (professionals): Joao Fiadeiro concentrates on atmospheres and states of being in which he collaborates closely with the creative abilities of his dancers. He has developed techniques such as ìcomposition in real-timeî which enable dancers to maintain a state of consciousness or a natural feeling while simultaneously overcoming their creative blockages. By working with the actual time of the performance, i.e. with the here and now, Fiadeiro orchestrates potential occurences that create a realistic area of the unexpected, of the unfamiliar familiarÖ. Fiadeiro danced with Ballett Gulbenkian and the Lisbon Dance Company in Portugal, then went to New York, where he became acquainted with American postmodernism through encounters with Trisha Brown, Steve Paxton, and David Gordon. After additional experiences with Dieter Heitkamp and Howard Sonnenklar in Berlin and Wim Vandekeybus in Belgium, he began developing his own choreographic work and founded the RE.AL. Company. (The course will be taught in English). The evening programs feature performances by internationally recognized artists such as: Rosemary Butcher, Anna Huber, Jonathan Burrows/Matteo Fargion, Neuer Tanz and many others.</span><br />						<br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Cindy Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: +49 / 89 / 724 25 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "Info"						var email2 = "jointadventures.net"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.jointadventures.net/en/twe" target="_blank">www.jointadventures.net/en/twe</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Jul 5 2005]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Aug 8 - 19, 2005</span> <span class='event'>Workshops with Nita Little</span> <span class='location'>London, London, UK</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>Nita Little is coming to London to teach two workshops 8th-12th August Surfing the Waves of Grace: The Principles of Contact Improvisation 15th-19th August Framing the Boundless: Crafting Experience Both courses will run from 12.00-6.00pm Nita Little has been performing, choreographing and teaching improvisational dance for the past 30 years. The emphasis of Nitaís work is the partnering form of Contact Improvisation, which she helped to evolve with among others Steve Paxton and Nancy Stark Smith and collaborated with them in numerous performing companies introducing Contact Improvisation throughout the USA. Nita will teach two workshops; Surfing the Waves of Grace: The Principles of Contact Improvisation will explore the underlying principles of CI, looking at action and the relationship of moving bodies. This is an opportunity to learn CI skills through integration of its principles and is developed for people who wish to go deeper into its foundations. This is appropriate and encouraged for dancers of all skill levels. Framing the Boundless: Crafting Experience will look to enhance the dancerís creative strength, spatial freedom and authenticity. We will look at the experience of the mind within the body, explore this ëmeeting groundí. How the mind and its boundless nature can enrich the dance with depth and breadth.

AM: MOTION TECHNIQUES A vigorous and detailed class focused on the act of motion from the inside out, encouraging sensation, articulation, conductivity and efficient power. A warm up of breath and energy work, improvisation, technical explorations and physics in all planes sets the stage for an extended phrase of dynamic, three-dimensional choreography. The class progresses from stillness to performance, offering a pro-active and supportive training ground for resonant and expressive dancing. The work is inspired by studies in modern, ballet, jazz, martial, energetic and release forms, Contact Improvisation, somatics, body work and play. PM: CONTACT IMPROVISATION Discover and practice the science and playground that is Contact Improvisation. Strengthen your body, open your mind and awaken your instincts. Explore sensory and physical experiments of shared touch, weight, gravity and momentum and expand into three-dimensional space, spontaneous composition, trust and risk. Engage in scores and open dancing and experience serious play - matching wits and methods, sharing common ground and sudden miracles - by surrendering to and shaping the dance in the moment. Be ready for joint creations with formal &amp; open structures and games, scores &amp; scenarios ranging from the whimsical to poetic, cooperative to aggressive, simple to complex.

Don't you need deeper communication with others through dance contact? Everybody has an unique and communicative sub-body in the deep darkness of the body. Sub-body means subconscious body=mind streams in your body. You can connect it through resting your daily conscious mind=body by using bottom breathing and swaying. Then you open transparent mind=body state, which keeps fifty-fifty balance between consciousness and subconscious. We guide you to travel into the darkness of your body where many kinds of complexes, deep memories, nightmares, traumas and dissociations are folded at. We have safe method to sink down into the deep body-mind streams and come back from there with keeping control. When you catch a subtle signal from sub-body streams, you can amplify it until your own sub-body dance by learning Jo-Ha-Kyu method originated by Noh dance tradition of Japan. We use not only "Physical contact technique", but also "Sub-body contact technique" which is orientated in the resonance between sub-body streams. "Sub-body method" was invented by Rhzome Lee(Japanese), through these twelve years investigation world travels of Butoh, Noh, Yoga, Tao, Contact Improvisation and so on. You can create your own unique dance with connecting to the bottom of your exsistense. And through the resonance between each sub-body dance, we can experience deep communications with yourself, others, life and death. You can have special dance travels at the Sub-body Hall, cool dance retreat in Dharamsala on the mountainside of the North India Himalaya Mountains. The workshop meets Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with occasional weekend activities.</span><br />						<span class='fee'>Tuition: $450, Room and Board: $200</span><br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Michie Kobayakawa, Rhizome Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: 91-98160-43030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "subbody"						var email2 = "hotmail.com"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.subbody.com" target="_blank">www.subbody.com (work in progress)</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Sep 2 2005]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Oct 12 - 16, 2005</span> <span class='event'>The Improvising Citizen with Keith Hennessy at Earthdance</span> <span class='location'>Plainfield, MA , USA</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>A workshop for dancers, performers, activists and citizens.

Our goal is to express our basic human experience in a way that connects with the public's. Contact improv (which comes from modern dance, martial arts, and gymnastics) and hip-hop are ideal for this because they are about social living. They have a raw, compelling energy that is physically, emotionally, and culturally rooted in everyday life. In principle anyone can do them - regardless of age, ethnicity, body type, schooling, and so on - and so a diverse audience can relate to what they show and say. Of course, for the moment contact improv and hip-hop _production_ are subcultures. Bringing them together and out into new communities is a key step toward more people being able to use them to grow, heal, and relate, as they choose. They will enrich the vocabulary and meaning of these artistic languages. Practices are Monday to Thursday, 2 hours a day in studio and 2 hours a day oudoors. Public performances - 1 in studio, 1 outdoors - complete the week on Friday. The event is hosted by Adam Gottlieb, an emerging contact improv dancer and experienced teacher and community worker. He has trained with Andrew Harwood, Nancy Stark Smith, Lisa Nelson, and Chris Aiken, among others, outside of a school or company setting. Recent workshops and performances include DanceWorkOutSide, Body Alchemy, Solo-Duo-Trio, and A Dance of Anger and Affirmation. He has volunteered with CKUT 90.3 FM, Action CommunauTerre community gardens, and other organizations. We are looking for 4 people who beatbox or spin, and 10 people who do or want to do contact improv and hip-hop (including breakdance). Those who wish will receive free training in contact improv dance and allied practices (stretches, self-massage, breathwork) that free the body to express itself, and will share their own skills.

Everybody has extreme creator in the darkness of body. The name is subbody. If you can open subbodyís creativity fully, you can originate your own dance which is the only one in the world. Subbody is a creator of our dream, fantasy, imagines, and dance. Subbody lives in the dark unconscious world. You can sink into the darkness of body where many kinds of complexes, deep memories, nightmares, traumas and dissociations are folded. We have safe method to guide you to the deep unconscious world and return back from there with keeping control yourself When you catch a subtle signal from sub-body streams, you can amplify it until your own sub-body dance by learning Jo-Ha-Kyu method originated by Noh dance tradition of Japan. We use not only "Physical contact technique", but also "Sub-body contact technique" which is orientated in the resonance between sub-body streams. "Sub-body method" was invented by Rhzome Lee(Japanese), through these twelve years investigation travels of Butoh, Noh, Yoga, Tao, Contact Improvisation and so on. You can create your own unique dance with connecting to the bottom of your exsistense. And through the resonance between each sub-body dance, we can experience deep communications with yourself, others, life and death. You can have special dance travels at the Sub-body Hall, cool dance retreat in Dharamsala on the mountainside of the North India Himalaya Mountains.
