					<dd>
						<span class='description'>I am hosting Contact Improv jams and lessons at my house on Siesta Key in Sarasota, Florida the first four months of 2007. I will teach you for free if you're new. The jams are usually 3-5 people, though will likely grow as more people learn about it. I have excellent CDs loaded with great music for contact. I have a huge living room with a large open space, 14 foot high ceilings, and giant windows that look out onto a private back yard with a lovely pond. It's easy to get to on the north side of Siesta Key. No experience needed - it's very easy to learn. If you're new, I can either show you prior to a jam or at a separate time set up by us. I'm also up for meeting at Lido beach or Siesta Key beach (if it's warm) to do or teach contact improv. At! the end of April I return to Massachusetts. I would love to build a great contact community down here for the four months each winter I'm here. For more information, call my cell phone, email me at the address below, or visit http://www.ContactImprovFL.org/.</span><br />

						<span class='description'>Contact Improv Workshop with Jez Parus: ‚ÄúWithout learning to know ourselves as intimately as we possibly can we limit our choice. Life is not very sweet without freedom of choice‚Äù -- Moshe Feldenkrais. Come develop greater complexity and satisfaction in your dancing, while exploring these questions: How does your desire to ‚Äúdo" create excess tension and effort? How do excess tension and effort interfere with freedom of choice? What happens when you drop excess tension and effort? How does lack of awareness lead you into action and interaction that injures, fatigues and bores you? Can skillfulness replace willfulness? Forget about answers, come dance the questions. Contact Improv Workshop with Karl Frost: This will primarily be a technical workshop, expanding the range of 3-dimensional availablility, power, and ease in the dance...off-balance, inversions, flight, diving, full-bodied moving together into and out of the floor and through the air. The more high-flying techniques will be supported by and balanced with more subtle explorations -- movement looked at in terms of millimeters, examining how we use our bodies and coordinate for greater ease, presence, self-reflection, and delight.</span><br />

We will step out of the role of teacher or student, will voice our specific curiosities and interests and will explore through the sharing of skills, techniques, approaches and styles. Topics studied will depend entirely on the curiosities of the individuals involved. Some time will be available for classes, open jams and discussion groups, however the majority of the time will be spent on focused physical practice, body-based research and investigation.

					</dt>
					<dd>
						<span class='description'>4 THURSDAYS, 7-9PM. (JAN 18, 25, FEB 1, 8.) HumilitySwim director Ali Woolwich teaches this quarterly 4-class workshop addressing Contact Improvisation Fundamentals--CI from "square one." Fundamentals for CI include, rather than specific "steps," the core pathways and levels of body awareness required to do this dance form. This workshop is great for 1st time beginners, as well as those who are feeling stuck in intermediate level classes because of gaps in training, those who want a good refresher course or those who want to revisit "beginners mind." Through discussion and dance "trouble-shooting" we'll comprehensively fill in the gaps resulting from infrequent attendance at drop-in classes, lack of jam experience, and/or long timegaps out of CI practice that cause rusty-ness! We will focus this work to find smooth, flowing, tuned-in dances, and sustained creative interest. Each student will get a one-on-one lesson with the instructor to address their specific questions or challenges. Jam etiquette and practice will be included in the material, to help you plug into the CI community and a regular CI practice. The last session will end with a facilitated jam period with experienced guest dancers. LOCATION: Studio Valencia, 455A Valencia @ 16th, San Francisco. Future Session Dates: Spring 07 begins April 5, Summer 07 begins May 31.</span><br />

					</dt>
					<dd>
						<span class='description'>Links Hall and Experimental Sound Studio (ESS) join their energies in an effort to precipitate new collaborations between Chicago-based sound artists and Chicago-based movement artists. Joint proposals are now invited, from which three pairs of newly collaborating artistic partners will be selected for support with a monetary grant of $5,000 per pair. Proposals will be reviewed by a committee made up of Lou Mallozzi (ESS), CJ Mitchell (Links Hall), Ginger Farley and two out-of-area artists, one from each discipline. Submission Criteria Artists will be asked to submit a five minute work sample and a one page artist‚Äôs statement (with the artist‚Äôs contact information) submitted to ESS by January 31, 2007. DVD/video/audio CD formats are welcome. The samples will be held in a short-term library housed at ESS until March 15, 2007 ‚Äì access is by appointment only (please contact Lou Mallozzi at ESS to make an appointment, lmallo@saic.edu (773) 769-1069). During this time interested artists can look and listen to materials and connect with others about potential creative projects. Ideas that spark can be formed into proposals for submission in April. We intend this process to offer a number of levels of possibility for cross-exposure between artistic communities, potentially stimulating new ideas and partnerships. (Note: the library is intended to foster new connections between artists, but proposals are not limited to artists who submit work samples to the ESS library.) Eligibility: ‚Ä¢ Priority will be given to full-time artists. ‚Ä¢ Each proposal should be jointly submitted by one Chicago-based sound artist and one Chicago-based movement artist. ‚Ä¢ Proposals must represent the first-ever collaboration between the applicants. ie. the sound and movement artists will not have collaborated together before. Please address the following items in writing in your proposal ‚Äì please do not exceed three pages in total: ‚Ä¢ Your names, contact mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. Website addresses are also welcome. ‚Ä¢ Describe your current areas of interest as artists. ‚Ä¢ A project description, including the goals and expectations of your collaboration, and a timeline charting the development and presentation of the work. Please address how participation in the CROSSCUT program would assist your creative process and development, and how the CROSSCUT award would be applied in your project budget. In addition, please submit: ‚Ä¢ Documentation of both artists‚Äô work on DVD/video/audio CD ‚Äì five minutes total from each artist (indicate cue points if necessary). Please include written information about the documented projects (eg date, location, collaborators, funders, presenters). ‚Ä¢ A one page r√©sum√© from each artist of your arts-related experience. Each selected pair of artists must co-create a work, which will be publicly presented before December 31, 2008. Funds may be used as best suits the artists: for production costs, to pay for research materials, as leverage to seek funding for a large-scale projects, or to subsidize daily living as artists focus on their work etc. Selected artists are expected to meet with ESS/Links at least once to discuss the progress of the work and to do at least one in-progress showing, public or private. The program does not provide artists with free use of ESS or Links Hall facilities and equipment, nor does it imply that artists should use those resources in the development and presentation of their new work. ESS and Links will actively work with artists on their strategies for the final presentation of the work. CROSSCUT intends to document the completed works. CROSSCUT Schedule: ‚Ä¢ APPLICATION DEADLINE 5PM, APRIL 15, 2007 ‚Ä¢ Notification to selected artists by May 15, 2007 ‚Ä¢ Meeting with Links/ESS and in-progress showings ‚Äì to be scheduled ‚Ä¢ Performance dates before December 31, 2008 ‚Ä¢ A Final Evaluation report is to be completed by the artists within one month of their presentation PLEASE MAIL OR DELIVER COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TO: Experimental Sound Studio 5925 N Ravenswood Ave Chicago, IL 60660 All written application materials should ALSO be emailed as a Word attachment/document readable by Mac OS-X to lmallo@saic.edu IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CONTACT Lou Mallozzi (ESS), lmallo@saic.edu (773) 769-1069</span><br />

					</dt>
					<dd>
						<span class='description'>Complexity Addicts and Other Work, opening March 2 at CounterPULSE, takes the audience on a wild ride through dance, theater, music, design, video and performance. First on the program is Bryan‚Äôs piece, Ego Alter, in which twelve performers act up and out, revealing 144 altered egos through dance, sound, and spatial harmonics pungent enough to permeate your tissues. A kaleidoscope of inner characters explodes across the stage in spiraling patterns of energy. Performers reveal outrageous inner voices ‚Äì individually possessed, yet mysteriously harmonic. Bryan takes inspiration from sacred geometry and Laban Movement Analysis to weave physical and emotional (dis) harmony with acrobatic, sensual movement animating 3-D interactive sets. An internationally acclaimed performer and choreographer, Bryan applies her expertise in Laban Movement Analysis and math to postmodern, interdisciplinary performance as director of Hilary Bryan Dance Theater. A Wisconsin native who trained in creative movement and ballet from the age of three, Bryan has performed extensively in Taiwan and in San Francisco. Rita Felciano showcased Bryan‚Äôs company as the most exciting and unusual local dance of January 2000 with work that ‚Äúwhetted (her) appetite for dance,‚Äù and the LA Times has lauded Bryan for her ‚Äúexceptional force and clarity.‚Äù The production also includes guest choreographers Meadow Leys and Marielle Amrhein. Within a matrix of diverse media, using sacred geometry, poetic symbol, and punk grace, Hilary Bryan Dance Theater has crafted a unique, dynamic, and memorable theatrical experience. Complexity Addicts will show at the Studio Theatre of UC Davis‚Äô Mondavi Center from February 15 ‚Äì 25 as part of SHARE, a shared MFA thesis concert with choreographer Keith Hennessy.</span><br />

						<span class='description'>5 Day Site-Specific Workshop Engaging the senses, perceptions, and the cartography of our bodies, The BodyCartography workshop investigates the physiology of the world around us and uses place as a medium to make art. We will utilize skills and materials developed from Contact Improvisation, Body-Mind Centering and composition to explore, survey, and compose the social and physical landscapes outside of the context of the dance studio and theater. The workshop breaks assumptions and renews possibilities of why and where art happens expanding our sense of self responsibility and eco-consciousness.

						<span class='description'>We cannot go through live without being influenced by all kind of meetings with human beings. During this weekend we will investigate, how these contacts happen and what our experiences are ... Starting from the own body we train the orientation with all senses in silence and movement. Where am I, and where are the others in the space ? It happens a game with distance and approximation. Where are my limits ? How can I expand them, how to protect ? And finally touching ... what is ok NOW and WHAT IS NOT OK ? And how to communicate it to my partner ? And the game is named CONTACT - IMPROVISATION . The teacher, Eva Brunner comes from Graz /Austria. She is a therapist, dancer and performer. Graduated from the School for New Dance Developement Amsterdam.

Further information on line around March You are interested in this workshop? Please send us your email address and we will send you a complete information as soon as possible.Le Bodycartograhy Project explore la relation du corps avec le paysage physique, architectural, technologique, climatique ou social que nous habitons dans un contexte urbain/naturel, public /priv√©. Codirecteurs de ce projet, Olive Bieringa et Otto Ramstad cr√©ent des compositions dans√©es, des vid√©os, des installations, proposent des actions et collaborations de terrain provoquant le public dans toutes sortes de contextes. Depuis 1997 ils ont cr√©√© des pi√®ces pour plus de 150 performances aux USA, au Canada, en Nouvelle Z√©lande, en Europe en Russie ainsi que 5 vid√©os qui ont √©t√© projet√©es internationalement. Ils proposent r√©guli√®rement des stages o√π ils partagent leur travail de performance sur sites sp√©cifiques en utilisant des outils d'improvisation, de contact improvisation, et de Body Mind Centering¬Æ. " A travers c! es stages, nous invitons les participants √† retrouver un app√©tit "primal" et une curiosit√© "infantile" pour aller explorer physiquement et engager le corps sensible. En travaillant √† un niveau visuel, kinesth√©sique, tactile et auditif, nous cherchons √† articuler le processus m√™me de la perception et √† d√©couvrir la composition inn√©e des espaces que nous investissons. The BodyCartography Project investigates the bodies‚Äô relationship to the physical, architectural, climatic, technological and social landscapes we inhabit in urban/wilderness and private/public contexts. As co-directors, Olive Bieringa and Otto Ramstad, build award winning dance works, film/video, installation works, and political actions through collaborative process to engage and provoke audiences in all kinds of contexts. Since 1997, they have created more than one hundred and forty performance events in the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Europe and Russia. They regulary offer educational worshops where they share their work with site-work performance, drawing tools from improvisational composition , contact improvisation, and Body Mind Centering¬Æ. ‚ÄúThrough these workshops we invite participants to enter their animal-like appetites and childlike curiosities for physical investigation through engagement of the sensorial body. Working on a visual, kinaesthetic, tacti! le and aural level we aim to articulate the very process of perception and discover the innate composition of the spaces we research and perform in.‚Äù</span><br />

						<span class='description'>Contact Improvisation: Compositional Tool / Performance Event? A course and laboratory for people with advanced skills in Contact Improvisation, exploring the use of those skills as both a compositional tool and a performance form. We will address issues of presence, connection with a partner, dynamics, virtuosity, utilizing scores and musical accompaniment. We will also explore staging, the integration of objects and the exploration of contact-based images. We will develop movement as both virtuosic, performative action and as meaningful theatrical image. We will examine the physical actualities of touch, manipulation, counterbalance, force, resistance, and surrender, both as physical states and as metaphors for interpersonal and intercultural relations. We will exami! ne and practice the state and quality of improvising, looking at a variety of relationships between imagination, action and time. Jess Curtis, Director/Choreographer, (SF/Berlin) has created a body of work ranging from the underground extremes of San Francisco‚Äôs Mission District warehouses with Contraband (1985-1994) to the formal refinement of European State Theaters with Jess Curtis/Gravity (2000-present). Along the way he was a member of the ground-breaking Franco-American Circus project Compagnie Cahin Caha, Cirque Batard (1998-2002) and co-founded the extreme performance collective CORE (1994-1998). www.jesscurtisgravity.org</span><br />

The training emphasizes powerful, organic transitions between the floor and standing and focuses on balance between dynamic flow and structural integrity. The class for professionals proposes a systematic approach to the physical and communicative principles of partner dancing within the context of performance improvisation. Participants explore the balance of sensing experiences of weight, friction and response with choice-making and inventiveness.

						<span class='description'>5 Day Site-Specific Workshop Engaging the senses, perceptions, and the cartography of our bodies, The BodyCartography workshop investigates the physiology of the world around us and uses place as a medium to make art. We will utilize skills and materials developed from Contact Improvisation, Body-Mind Centering and composition to explore, survey, and compose the social and physical landscapes outside of the context of the dance studio and theater. The workshop breaks assumptions and renews possibilities of why and where art happens expanding our sense of self responsibility and eco-consciousness. The location Earthdance's facilities include: -two large and sunny studios with sprung maple floors and radiant heat -an 1812 renovated farmhouse which comfortably accommodates 28 people -a cabin for quiet, meditative personal retreat -a wood stoked sauna nestled in the woods beside a spring fed quarry -125 acres of woods, stream, trails, and flowering meadows Earthdance invites you for workshops, contact improv jams, personal and group retreats throughout the year. Located within driving distance of New York and Boston, we welcome individuals and groups to create, inspire, relax and heal in the glorious Berkshire hills. Mission Statement Earthdance provides a gathering place that inspires the art and spirit of improvisation. We support and train people at all skill levels to find and develop expression in movement, theater and music. The influence of nature and the ongoing contributions of community members and skilled teachers enliven workshops, jams, peer-led groups, and retreats.

						<span class='description'>Music and Dance ‚ÄòOn the Way Home‚Äô The Five Great Elements Workshop Instructed by Orly Portal and Shai Dayan Music and dance are powerful primary channels, through which one can experience his or her oneness with existence. In ancient cultures they were used as ritual tools to bridge between man and God, but in western society they got placed upon a stage, fenced off as art, and lost of their accessibility as a daily, direct, joyful and liberating experience. Music and dance are tools that enable us to learn the way to freedom - a state in which a person ceases to perceive oneself as separate from the whole, and becomes liberated from the need to be someone or something. In the core of the experience of freedom lies the realization that there‚Äôs one source to all. The Five Great Elements (according to Yogic tradition) - In one small seed treasured the entire universe. In order to manifest itself, the seed needs EARTH to contain and nourish it, WATER to revive it, AIR to breath and move its components, FIRE to transform them and ETHER to give space for all to happen. Like the seed, man built of a body that contains and nourishes him, emotion that flows within, desire that drives him, knowledge that transforms him and a soul that unifies him. These are the cornerstones of our worldly existence. The value of that perspective is that when we become aware of these forces, and the way they act in the outside as well as the inside world, we can learn a lot about ourselves and the world; and maybe it can remind us that we are not a separate and limited unit in a strange world, as we tend to feel, but the world itself. Each person has his own particular constitution, built out of a different combination of the great elements; no two humans are the same. But the deeper we go, the clearer it becomes that we are, in fact, unified. In the workshop we will explore and experience the great elements with our body, mind and spirit. Each day will be dedicated to a different element. We will use movement, music, voice and conversation to get familiar with the different forces. We will witness their manifestations in the different levels of being, from the simplest body functions, to the more subtle states of awareness. It is a process of unfoldment, which means removing rather then adding. Come with open minds and a sincere will to let go. The workshop is for all freedom seekers.</span><br />

					</dt>
					<dd>
						<span class='description'>This year‚Äôs GLACIER, an annual five-day retreat (with weekend option) is a time to go within and find the movement that lives in your bones and blood and heart and toes and skull ‚Äì and bring that dance into relationship with friends old and new. Find dances that are comforting, or challenging, or both. Return to your roots or treat yourself to something adventurous; then ‚Äúre-treat‚Äù yourself to the safety of home. The structure of the five days will serve to guide our dancing together, funneling it from the wide open and exuberant possibilities of our jam time, into a quiet center of personal, contemplative movement investigation, and back out again into dynamic and refined, collaborative scores. The Christine Center, located in central Wisconsin, is a tranquil, spiritual retreat center on 120 acres of wooded land. The accommodations include guest house rooms, woodland cabins, and camping. Wholesome and natural vegetarian meals are prepared in the kitchen and are served in a central dining room. Other amenities include a sauna, hiking trails, and beautiful dance space. The facility, including dance space is wheelchair accessible. More information about the center, including a map and driving directions, can be found at: www.christinecenter.org</span><br />
						<span class='fee'>The cost ranges from $75 - $175 for the weekend or $200 - $405 for the five days, depending upon choice of housing and meals. Registration Deadline: August 25, 2007 (must be postmarked by this date). Turn in your registration form to your local registrar with a $75 deposit (check made out to Fluid Measure Performance Company), in order to reserve your spot. If you have no local registrar, mail your registration to Stefanie Cohen. (Registrations postmarked after August 25 will incur a $25 late fee). Limited scholarships/workstudy is available upon request, with an application deadline of August 25th. Children are welcome and some child care is available upon request. Spouses/partners are also welcome; contact Stefanie for more information about children &amp; spouses/partners.</span><br />

					</dt>
					<dd>
						<span class='description'>What does it mean to be ready to dance at any time, with anyone, anywhere ? There are no set formulas, but there is an attitude and a state of mind and body that can be cultivated toward this objective. Being completely attentive and always prepared on all levels, will enable us to go beyond thinking our way through the dance, and help us be attuned to what is actually taking place. This total presence allows us to be freed of the mental chatter, planning ahead, and judgement, which so often override the body‚Äôs ability to make appropriate split-second choices. In this way the improvisations can be entirely physical, playful, heartfelt, surprising and enjoyable. Explored themes will include: tumbling, flying, use of variable speeds, use of ! direct action and initiation, resistance, disappearance, subtle ways of moving weight, flowing through unfamiliar circumstances, extending our personal range of movement, and integrating our imagination and our heart. Because of the advanced nature of this workshop, this intensive is for those with a solid grasp of Contact fundamentals and with at least two ongoing years of regular C.I. practice. Times: 11.00 - 18.00. Venue: Moving East, St Matthias Church Hall, Wordsworth Road, Stoke Newington, London, N16 8DD.</span><br />

						<span class='description'>Improvisation into Contact with Kathy Crick and Irmela Stone (nee. Wiemann) Mon 26 - Fri 30 Nov 2007: 11.15am-1pm. at The Jerwood Space, London This one-week of improvisation classes will draw on the individual approach of two luminaries from the worlds of contact and improvisation: Kathy Crick &amp; Irmela Stone (nee. Wiemann). Classes will explore embodied presence and improvisational skills in solo and ensemble dancing, as a wider context from which to integrate moving in and out of contact work. Mapping the body through movement imagery to facilitate detailed engagement with the sensory and energetic body; listening to our own dancing to support receptivity and responsiveness to others; supporting the emergence of composition with structures for solo, small group and ensemble dancing, both in and out of contact.
