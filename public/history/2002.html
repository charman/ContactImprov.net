						WORKSHOP: IMPROVISING CONTACT-IMPROVISATION<br />
						<p>
							Contact Improvisation will be the common ground to continue and deepen our skills to come into a physical and kinaesthetic dialogue with others. In solo's, duets and in larger configurations, we will strengthen the awareness of our sensory input and sensibilities in improvising. By developing an awakened, alert and articulated presence in our dancing, we will strengthen our abilities to create dances that are imaginative and playful. Dances in which we can expect to be in physical contact at any moment and at the same time keeping an awareness of ones own direction in improvising. Five days of dancing, music and theatrical improvisations at the Palazzo Caravajal Simoncelli, venue of the ALEFdanzaateatro Productions Company.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Festival-Laboratory is a gift to the world of theatre improvisation and a unique, one of its kind, appointment in Italy. FREE DANS ORVIETO is divided into more than one level: from the Workshop in the morning, to the Study Labs in the afternoon, to the Jam sessions in the early evening, to the late evening Performances. Choreographers, dancers, musicians and performers will come together for the ZIP to elaborate spontaneous studies of improvisation, that will be presented to the public in an involving Performances of Dance-Music-Theatre on the evenings of January 4, 5, and 6, 2002.
						</p>

						<p>
							As long as I have been performing, I have been improvising. instantaneous or real-time composition is an ongoing artistic process for me for over 25 years now. It comes back to the basic need to move and express ideas and emotions through the vehicle of our body and mind. Through exploration in improvisation, Contact Improvisation, and chance procedures, we will practice instant inventiveness, refine our sensing skills and develop compositional strategies, which will become the framework for composing solo, duet and group material. A deliciously deep warm up will entice us into this world.

						A Contact Improvisation Research Intensive. This event is designed for people that want to immerse themselves in C.I., as form for investigating who they are and how they relate, on and off the dance floor. The group (maximum 12) will research the principles of the C.I. and how they apply to dancing and living, together. Each day working sessions will occur to present principles and create space to explore, discover and integrate the material. San Miguel is a fun place to dance; at the studio, a near-by canyon, the hot springs, a school for children with disabilities and about the town. Our intent is to explore living simply and intimately through contact and improvisation. Carolynâs love affair with C.I. spans 17 years, many countries and innumerable surfaces. She keeps returning to San Miguel for the winter sun and the extraordinary magic she encounters there. A few special dancing amigos will join her in facilitating this intensive.

						Confidence is enhanced and personal safety increased when you learn to fall in any given situation, at any moment, at any speed through one's central axis or off center, alone or with others. Maintaining lightness and suspension while falling helps cultivate resiliency. This buoyancy enables us to soar gracefully through space and connect us with lofting or flying.

Then mark your calendars and come dance at the 6th Annual Moab Jam in Moab, Utah.
						<p>
							<b>Workshop</b>: April 28th to May 1, 2002 (Sun. to Wed. @ 10-Noon &amp; 2-5 daily)<br />
							<b>Jam:</b> May 2nd to May 5th, 2002 (Thurs. 3pm to Sun. 3pm)<br />
							<b>Campout:</b> May 6th to May 18th, 2002 (~2 weeks, Mon 6th to Sat 18th)<br />
							You are welcome to join us for as much of this event as you can.
						</p>
						<p>
							Moab in the spring time is a magical place. Have you ever seen the desert in bloom? Typically you can find dozens of different flowering cactus and other wildflowers in just a short hike. The air is soft and dry and the bright sunshine typically radiates the perfect warmth at about 75-85 degrees. It's the ideal place to come and enjoy lots of dancing and exploring in the desert.
						</p>
						<p>
							New to this year's Jam is the Workshop, just before the jam. It's an <a href="http://www.contact-improv.com/omygod" target="_top">omygod! Exploratorium</a> in Contact Improvisation with Carolyn Stuart, Bryce Kasson and Johanna Sodermark. The 4 days will use a simple investigative process to embody and integrate the principles of the form, on and off the dance floor. If you are new to contact improv, this is a great way to prepare yourself for a jam. If you are experienced, this is an opportunity to refine your skills and share what you know with others.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the Jam and Workshop we will dance at the Moab Arts and Recreation Center. It has nice hard wood dance floors and tall windows that let in plenty of bright sunshine. The group will car-camp at a campground nearby town.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the Campout, which is right after the Jam, we will camp at the same place as last year, just outside Canyonlands National Park next to Indian Creek. Check out the beautiful pictures on the website. From our campsite we will take day trips to dance, hike and explore the nearby waterfalls, narrow water-carved slot canyons, grand mesa overlooks and red-rock mazes. Plus, this year Carolyn, Bryce and Johanna will be continuing the practices of the omygod! Exploratorium during the campout and welcome your participation.

						2 days of Contact Improvisation with Patrick Crowley<br />
						<p>
							Saturday, May 11, 1:30-5:30 Beginning/advanced beginning<br />
							Skills of listening to and developing movement from the contact point with a partner, pouring and receiving weight, sensing breath and the internal body, letting momentum give us a ride, moving from center and core, falling, rolling. We will deepen into this foundation as we trust and move our impulses. For beginners and those with experience.

							Sunday, May 12, 1:30-5:30 Mixed level<br />
							Working developmentally, we continue our research of movement with a partner in the physical forces of gravity and momentum. States of groundedness and buoyancy will bring us into explorations of supporting, flying, and moving from a spherical center. Staying open moment to moment to sensation, feeling, imagination and our environment will bring presence and exciting dancing!
