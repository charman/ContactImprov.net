				<span class='description'>Martial Movement Class Cultivating Power not Force This group is for movers, dancers, and martial artists who want to explore the use of power and flexibility from an "inside out" orientation. The work is around the release of muscular tension and 'over' reaction to cultivate more power and grace. The form combines the practices of Feldenkrais Movement, Aikido and Contact Improvisation. The dynamics include resisting/releasing, centering/falling, leading/following, pushing/pulling, stillness/flow. The classes begin with Feldenkrais exercises. From skeletal movements, breath and partner work, movement progresses to partner work using weight, power and direction. The ongoing focus will be on the contact point, skeletal movement and energy transfer</span><br />

				<span class='description'>Caravajal15 residenza dinamica Orvieto-Italy \\ Projects 2008 \\ We are happy to announce that Simone Forti will be again our special guest artist in residence, with her intensive workshop Logomotion Writing Workshop. \\\\\\\\\\\\\ The intensive workshop with Simone Forti is in the ambit of our projects 2008, and will be from March 8 to 15 in the city of Orvieto, in Italy. \\ The places for the workshop are limited to 16 participants. Is a 7-day project workshop, plus one day pause \\\\ The intensive workshop will be held at the headquarters of the cultural Association Caravajal15 residenza dinamica, in the prestigious sixteenth century rooms of the Palazzo Caravajal-Simoncelli, in the beautiful Etruscan city of Orvieto, mid Italy. \\ The fee includes hospitality, recepti! on and meals. Application for registration is open from October 15th. \\\\ Logomotion Writing Workshop: Sometimes our words don't have access to what we know in our bones. In this workshop we will be improvising moving and speaking, and we will be writing. While our writing will stimulate our imagination and support our improvisations, our improvisations will enrich our writing with a kinesthetic timing to phrasing and windows on sudden thoughts and memories. Our activities will include studio sessions of improvisational moving and speaking, spontaneous writing,walks in town, with partners, for conversations about matters large and small, and private times to write and to craft our writings and to read them to each other. We will borrow from the writing practice of Natalie Goldberg as found in her books Writing Down the Bones and Wild Mind, discovering the associations that gather spontaneously around a chosen point of departure. As our movement work w! ill include many activities in partners and in groups, some of! our wri ting will include more than one voice, focusing on the relationships between the thoughts of different people. A goal will be to write with wild mind and intention, and with awareness of world. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Lodging in the residence: we are organized with mattresses that the participants can use, scattered here and there in the 150 square meters of the studio. You have to bring your own sleeping bag and a blanket, or sheets, pillow and blanket, as you prefer. There's a room in residence equipped for preparing breakfast and meals, in addition to dressing rooms and showers. One person will cook for us during the seven days of the project. Lunch will be light (fruit, rice, vegetables and/or cheese, cookies, honey, tea, coffee, etc.). Evenings a dinner will be offered.</span><br />

				<span class='description'>A mind in motion and Contact Improvisation experience // Residential workshop for experienced movers // The American artist Nita Little will be the special guest of our association, first time in Italy as guest artist, for giving the project "Restless Peace". The intensive workshop with Nita Little is in the calendar of our Residential Projects 2008, and will be from April 25 to May 2, 2008 in the beautiful Etruscan city of Orvieto, in middle Italy. /// After the end of the workshop, on May 3rd and 4th, the association will plan also two days with the International Springfest Jam. // The intensive workshop and the Jam will be held both at the headquarters of the cultural Association Caravajal15 residenza dinamica, in the prestigious sixteenth century rooms of the P! alazzo Caravajal-Simoncelli, in Orvieto. // RESTLESS PEACE // The urge to move, to go where we have never been, is the soul of our practice in this workshop. Developing a "home base", a place of personal and creative safety is as important as the journey; how wonderful to be free when you have a home! We learn, how like nomads, we may carry our home with us, even as we track paths in and out of unfamiliar territory. We focus on developing the mental, emotional, and physical skills that enable dancers to travel creatively. Utilizing a full dance vocabulary, we integrate gestured movement improvisation with contact improvisation and build the skills to consciously weave these two forms. We investigate "states" of mind / "states" of body as a means to develop and direct creative work in our improvisations. Developing the ability to describe and craft subtle levels of action and experience, we boost our physical potential while increasing our reada! bility. Moving in solo, duet and group forms, we gain composit! ional to ols for structural orientation; like torches, they light the way. This workshop is developed for experienced movers who wish to pass beyond the threshold of old patterns. The restless human drive that takes us out of comfort, urges us to meet the unfamiliar, to move into, through and with the unknown, is a dance artist's call. Here, we harness that drive and discover how, moving at the speed of our restless calling, we can find peace. This class culminates in a creative work for performance at the workshop and at Zipfest08. Things we will do: Go deep into the physical philosophy behind contact improvisation. Learn underlying CI principles that manifest as pathways of action. Build the tools for safe physical and creative relationships Discover different spatial orientations: vertical/hierarchical and horizontal/diffuse. Learn about our temporal orientation and develop tools that modulate time. Develop the skills to be able to move freely between states of mind. Deepen ! our agreements to open to life, to the dance. Honor peace. // ABOUT NITA LITTLE // www.nitalittle.com // Nita Little has been developing, choreographing, performing and teaching improvisational dance for the past thirty-six years, notably Contact Improvisation, which she helped evolve from its inception with Steve Paxton, Nancy Stark Smith and others. She collaborated in numerous performing companies introducing Contact Improvisation throughout the United States. She is a master teacher with former students all over the world, who are themselves now master dancers and teachers: Gretchen Spiro, Andrew Harwood, Frey Faust, Scott Wells, Julie Oak, Peter Bingham to name just a few. Through CI she discovered her abiding interest in the evolution of consciousness and the mind body relationship. Since 1981 she has been developing an evolving curriculum called The Mind in Motion, which explores the range of experiential states along the mind-body continuum and reveals principles th! at define Contact Improvisation as well as other movement form! s. This work is informed by her investigation of the mind through work such as hypnotherapy and NeuroLinguistic Programming. As a performing artist her current work is a mix of both formal and improvisational choreography and scores. While anchored in process, it frequently explores character, story, and concept. Nita received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in choreography and was on the California Arts Council Touring Program. The latter award was to her solo dance company, NITA LITTLE DANCE THEATRE, which she began in 1984, continued through 1990, and reinstated as a pickup company in 2000. In 2002 Nita created Playing God, an hour-long dance opera that received funding through the Dance USA /National Endowment for the Arts. Over the years Nita has been both faculty and guest artist at numerous colleges and universities including New York University, California Institute for the Arts, Texas Christian University, Temple University, Tufts University, Scripps College an! d UC Santa Barbara. Nita teaches and performs yearly at national and international dance festivals including ImPulsTanz, Vienna, The Side Step Festival, Helsinki, Kontakt Budapest International Improvisation Festival, the International Contact Festival Freiburg, Germany,the Seattle Festival of Alternative Dance and Improvisation and the West Coast Contact Improvisation Festival, Berkeley California. She also teaches locally and nationally throughout the year. She lives with her son in Santa Cruz Mountains in California. As she has pioneered a path in the understanding of the mind/body/spirit relationship, Nita's mission, conscious evolution, has been the backbone of her passion and her practice. Her goal is to see, feel and reveal grace in all its forms and as it exists in the actions of the mind and the body.</span><br />

				<span class='description'>A weekend workshop in Contact Improvisation with Steve Batts will take place on Saturday 7th and Sunday 8th June at Echo Echo Dance Theatre Company's Derry dance studio. Steve Batts is Co-artistic Director of Echo Echo but also teaches Contact Improvisation (C.I) internationally. Steve has been dancing and teaching Contact since the early 1980s. He describes it as one of his biggest and most consistent joys in life. He has taught workshops at many dance festivals in countries such as Israel, Russia, Germany and Romania. While Contact Improvisation has a huge influence on Steve's artistic work, he tries to teach it from the point of view of a participant rather than a director. The previous workshop, held in March, was a huge success with a record turnout of participants from all over Ireland and beyond. Echo Echo didn't want to leave it too long before offering another workshop so here it is!</span><br />

We will bring together elements of each dance to create a richer and liberating form of physical expression. The objective is to reach to an improvised dance of great clarity of form and at the same time, free and instinctive in it's expression. From tango we'll borrow : the clarity of axis, the interplay of balances and counter balances, rhythm, use of Spirals. From Contact improvisation we'll borrow: principles of Martial Arts useful for Cimpro, falls, levas, grounding, the conscious use of centripetal and centrifugal forces, the freedom of form. There is no need to have any experience in either both techniques. Leilani Weis, chilean. Teaches, experiments and performes Contact Improvisation and Tango.

Has trained different teather groups in Cuba, Mexico, Spain and Italy. Has teached in International festivals in Freiburg and Orvieto and collaborate with the University for Motory Sience in Rome. She is co-founder and co-director of Central de Movimiento Company where she explores the improvisation as a way to create moving pieces in combination with other art forms. Javier Cura is an argentine american multidisciplinary artist. He has dedicated himself to the Fine Arts creating several art exhibitions of objects, sculptures and instalations.

We will begin and end our trip at Sierra Hot Springs, one of California's lesser-known gems. Drawing inspiration from the everyday miracles of the natural world, Scott will work his magic during daily contact improvisation classes while Aaron will provide wilderness skills instruction. (No previous backpacking experience is necessary.) Come play with us! Scott Wells In 1981 Scott discovered the pleasure of contact improvisation shortly after becoming obsessed with the struggles of modern dance. He stuck with both and currently directs a company and tours annually to Europe. In 2005 Scott received the San Francisco Award for Outstanding Choreography and was selected by Dance Magazine as "one of the 25 To Watch in 2005". About Aaron Jessup The founder of OutsideIn Adventures, Aaron has been leading wilderness trips since 2000. Aaron's trips are influenced by his eclectic background as a circus performer, whitewater raft guide, bodyworker and contact improvisation dance teacher. In 2006 he completed a yearlong wilderness survival, wildlife tracking and ecology program.</span><br />

			<dd>
				<span class='description'>A journey of Perception and Action. In this week we will dive deep into the body and swim into movement. It is an individual as well as group journey into body and motion. Each of us will keep a journal of this journey with questions and impressions about our own fascinations, curiosities and challenges. Working deeply with perception and movement we can allow new experience and transformation to happen; training our capacity to be present as we stay close to the sensation, finding a ground in the body as a place of rest and well being. Working with partners as witness and mirror of our process, able to perceive and been perceived. We will work with touch in different ways with different purposes, refining our capacity to be direct and specific in the way we touch and communicate with another body. We will explore specific movement qualities and patterns, which will inform and enrich our movement experience. We will work in the studio, in other parts of the building and outside in nature, to engage into sensational journey and to create and experience movement on location. Making dances in different configurations from a clear question, impression, experience, space perspective, time perception.... This approach focuses on the development of a kinesthetic sense of the body and is influenced and informed by the work of physical theatre, body-mind centering, contact, instant composition, release technique and Yoga.</span><br />

				<span class='description'>What is, is enough- to go exploring.... The purpose of this gathering is to explore ourselves and how we relate via the act of contact improvising. This is not a workshop in which you'll be taught how to 'do' contact improvisation. It is, instead, a week to refine and enhance your ability to explore being in contact, improvising. This is an experiment in what it means to co-create- in the dance, in the kitchen, in front of an audience, in the moment..... This is an opportunity to immerse in magic and mystery of contact improvising, to discover what touch and movement have to teach us about dancing and life. All are welcome. Each begins where they are and grows according to their own interest and curiosity. Performance will be used to explore seeing and being seen and is always optional. Each day will consist of 3 working times. In the mornings we'll do an authentic movement or contemplative dance practice. In the afternoons we'll explore contact improvising and in the evening we'll share, show&amp;tell, perform... w/Carolyn Stuart- Explorer/teacher/performer of C.I. since 1984, calling her thread of investigation the Touchmonkey path. She's currently involved in translating her map of contact improvising into English and curious about how it applies to living life.

				<span class='description'>Contact Camp has been a fixture on the playa for the past three years, and we're bringing it back in style for 2008. We've got some new infrastructure, a distributed leadership team, and a new on-line registration system. We plan to better coordinate work party participation and work shift participation prior to the event so that we're not spending valuable time on the playa figuring it all out. Camp CONTACT will host 80-100 Contact Improvisators for the ten days spanning Saturday, August 23rd to Monday, Sept 1st. We'll start off by building a kitchen, a common area and the dance spaces. We'll also have shade structures to keep your tent cool, with the possibility of other amenities. We come to the playa to offer the gift of Contact Improvisation. Mornings, we'll be able to jam in Burning Man's Center Camp; afternoons, we can teach or take beginners and advanced classes. Each evening we will share in community meals and then glow in all that Black Rock City has to offer at night, including some of our own jams. If you're into Contact, and up for the adventure of a lifetime, check us out! If you've camped with us before, we welcome you back. More details, commitment requirements, and on-line registration are available on our website at http://campcontact.org/burningcontact</span><br />
				<span class='fee'>$145-$185 US, plus cost of admission to Burning Man. You'll also need to cover the cost of camping equipment, water and other items. Register at the site below.</span><br />

			</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class='description'>This workshop weaves together exploratory research in dance, somatics and ecological thinking into a sustainable life model. It is our belief that in order to tackle the questions we face in the world today, we need to start with our perceptions. Participants will be invited to experience a state that goes beyond their own cultural believes. By deconstructing perceptual concepts of any nature, habitual patterns, lifelong conditionings as well as many limiting mindsets they will be encouraged to question their own belief systems. This unfamiliar landscape, which may appear frightening at times, in fact may provide an extremely fertile terrain for new discoveries. One way to recover our ethical base and understanding our interconnected nature with our surroundings is to 'dance our thinking'. In this workshop, we will integrate movement and deep ecology. You will acquire an understanding of: Interconnectivity between your thoughts and actions; How your perceptions affect interaction with the natural world; A clearer view of relationships with the world around you; The value of art to ecology and ecology to art; The interplay between art and science; Gain skills of touch and somatic expression; How to live more sustainably in a world of constant change; The parallel between how you treat yourself and how you treat the natural world Taught by four international art and sustainability educators, the training will include Laban/Bartenieff, contact-improvisation, somatics/bodywork, permaculture and nature awareness methodologies. The workshop will take place at Gut Stolzenhagen, one hour north of Berlin, a dance center in peaceful natural surroundings. This workshop is designed for artists and facilitators from all areas, who are searching for ways to integrate creative and ecological approaches and research their impact on our daily lives. Facilitators: Satu Palokangas, Stefa Roth, Bruno Caverna, Lars Schmidt Location: Ponderosa Guesthouse / Gut Stolzenhagen, 16248 Stolzenhagen near Berlin</span><br />
				<span class='fee'>Fee: 260 &euro; / early registration discount (when booked by July 31st): 230 &euro; + Food in Stolzenhagen: 60 &euro; + Housing in Stolzenhagen: 28 &euro;, or more if you want a (semi-)private room</span><br />

				<span class='description'>Being Ready - an intermediate-advanced course in Contact Improvisation with Andrew Harwood. A Five day intensive workshop with Andrew Harwood - an internationally respected teacher and one of the key figures in the development of Contact Improvisation. What does it mean to be ready to dance at any time, with anyone, anywhere ? There are no set formulas, but there is an attitude and a state of mind and body that can be cultivated toward this objective. Being completely attentive and always prepared on all levels, will enable us to go beyond thinking our way through the dance, and help us be attuned to what is actually taking place. This total presence allows us to be freed of the mental chatter, planning ahead, and judgement, which so often override the body's ability to make appropriate split-second choices. In this way the improvisations can be entirely physical, playful, heartfelt, surprising and enjoyable. Explored themes will include: tumbling, flying, use of variable speeds, use of direct action and initiation, resistance, disappearance, subtle ways of moving weight, flowing through unfamiliar circumstances, extending our personal range of movement, and integrating our imagination and our heart. Bio Andrew de Lotbiniàre Harwood is the artistic director of AH HA Productions a project oriented company focusing on improvisation as a performing art. Andrew is recognized as an exceptional international teacher, performer and creator in the field of instantaneous choreography and contact improvisation since 1975. His work has been presented in numerous international festivals since 1980 (Impuls Tanz, La Biennale, Festival Montpellier, F.I.N.D., Festival des Antipodes, IF/ New York, Bates Dance Festival, etc). He has danced with the companies of Fulcrum, Jo Lechay, Marie Chouinard, and Jean-Pierre Perreault, and has collaborated with many renowned dance artists including Steve Paxton, Nancy Stark Smith, Lisa Nelson, Kirstie Simson, Peter Bingham, Chris Aiken, Ray Chung and Benoit Lachambre among many others. His background includes athletics, gymnastics, yoga, modern dance, Release Technique, improvisation and Aikido. He was awarded the Canada Council's Jacqueline Lemieux dance award in 2000.
