SUMMARY: The Urban Research Theater is an institute for practical research in physical and vocal craft. Performance artists, practitioners of traditional forms, and other interested parties are invited to enter into specific lines of inquiry with the human body and voice. The use of props, notebooks, spoken language and other technologies will be strictly limited. This work can be a kind of active meditation, focused on balancing precision with spontaneity. We will practice stretches, exertions, repetitions, precise movement structures, and song fragments as tools for developing quality in awareness. LEADERSHIP: Ben Spatz has directed multiple theater projects in New York City and Poland, ranging in duration from two weeks to six months. He recently returned from two years in Poland, where he was an apprentice at the Centre for Theatre Practices Gardzienice and a Fulbright fellow at the Centre for the Study of Jerzy Grotowski's Work and for Cultural and Theatrical Research. In the United States he has worked with the Cornerstone Theater Company, Cirque Boom, North American Cultural Laboratory, and This is a Science Project. For more information, see website. COMMITMENT: The work session will run for seven weeks in January and February of 2006. There will be a regular schedule of approximately twenty hours per week, four hours per day, five days per week. This schedule is most appropriate for people working 9-5 jobs, who do not have any other other outside commitments. LOCATION AND FEE: We will work in a clean, accessible studio space in Manhattan. A fee of $300 will be used to cover space rental and organizational costs. There is one full scholarship available. APPLICATION: Five to seven participants will be accepted. To apply, send a letter of interest and resume to the address above by December 18, 2005. No background in theater is required, but participants should have some experience with song or movement. Preference will be given to those who are potentially interested in continuing after February.</span><br />						<span class='fee'>$300 for seven weeks, twenty hours per week.

This year's workshop will include physical training and exploration of questions such as: What kind of preparation/structure do we need in order to pursue the dancing that is most meaningful and satisfying on physical, aesthetic, intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and compositional levels? How does the internal experience of dancing relate to what is seen? How can we simultaneously strengthen physical, experiential, and compositional concerns? How can we integrate Contact Improvisation into a broader field of improvised dancing/dancemaking without losing its particular integrity and depth?</span><br />						<span class='fee'>Tuition: $675-$750 sliding scale (with deposit of $150 received by November 23, 2005; $700-$750 thereafter) Room and Board: $495 (plus 3-5 hours housework per week)</span><br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Kristin Horrigan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: (413) 320-3299&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "januaryworkshop"						var email2 = "nancystarksmith.com"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.nancystarksmith.com" target="_blank">www.nancystarksmith.com</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Aug 24 2005]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Jan 11 - Mar 15, 2006</span> <span class='event'>MOVE</span> <span class='location'>Worcester, Massachusetts, US</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>One-hour jam that offers a safe and inviting space for all people 18 and over to relieve stress, have fun, and explore creative expression through movement.Wednesdays, 11:30am-12:30pm Session 1: January 11- February 8, 2006 Session 2: February 15- March 15, 2006.

Wir m&amp;GG#246;chten dich in einen Raum einladen, in dem unterschiedliche Kunstformen mit dem Fokus auf Improvisation sich begegnen und austauschen, sich miteinander verweben und verschmelzen, wo Grenzen sich auflösen und neu gefunden werden. Bring all deine Verrücktheit, all deine Liebe, Spiel- und Bewegungsfreude in einen Austausch mit dir selbst und anderen. Lass dich bewegen, berühren und verwandeln, komm mit auf eine Reise, die dich in Wildheit und Stille führen kann. Begegne dir selbst, in dem du dich dem Augenblick hingibst. Önothing remains to do. You only have to understand the movement of the energy, the unintentional movement of the energy. It flows, but not directed to a goal, more as a celebration ,like in dance. It does not move because it likes to reach a goal, rather because it slops over by its ownÖ Dear dancers, contacters,actors, fools, musicians, painters, life artists all colours and Easterhares who love to improvise Welcome to the EasterImproFestival!!! We are happy to invite you again to a space where different arts based on improvisation can meet, exchange and be mixed up. Please bring all your crazyness, all your love, all your playfulness and your joy of movement into a process of exchange with yourself and others. Let yourself be moved, touched and transformed, get a ride, which may lead you into silence or wilderness. Get in touch with your nature through the way of improvisation!

With the trees holding us from just outside the windows, we will explore the world of Authentic Movement interspersed with yoga, meditation, and ritual. This will be a spacious weekend with time for writing or drawing, and a long break each day for meals, long walks, resting...along with, of course, abundant movement time. Weather permitting, we will do some movement outside in Concord's "Fairy Wilderness," near Walden Pond. ------------ More About Authentic Movement: Authentic Movement is a dance form that focuses on following the threads of our inner impulses. It is from these impulses that our movement comes. Moving them, dancing them, brings into physical being the fabric of the stories of our bodies. Within the structure of the form we try on the roles of both mover and witness. This is usually followed by writing, drawing, and/or speaking to integrate and further develop the movement experience. Authentic Movement is a meditative, expressive, creative and spiritual practice. It is explored by some to deepen compassion, and acceptance, and by others simply for the joy of movement. It is practiced by dancers, musicians, writers, visual artists, and others to source material. No dance or movement experience is necessary. ------------ About the Instructor: Shakti Andrea Smith is a dancer and bodyworker practicing and teaching in New York City and New England. She teaches Yoga, Authentic Movement, Contact Improvisation, and Dance Meditation. Other influences include ritual, being in nature, and other pathways to being more fully alive and present in this moment. Shakti has a degree in Transpersonal Psychology and has been inhabiting the world with Authentic Movement since 1992.

Participants will explore giving and taking weight, rolling, falling, sliding, lifting, jumping; a full range of movements. At the heart of the dance is listening; both to a partner and to our own bodies. It will engage the whole person and is an opportunity to find the dance which exists within the decisions and non decisions between two people. This workshop will take a developmental pathway from exploring a deeper experience of the movement potential of our own bodies, through to working with a partner and discovering different pathways in which we can follow our sensations of weight, momentum and our relationship to gravity. Charlie Morrissey is a dance teacher, performer and director who has been working nationally and internationally for fifteen years. He has worked with many of the key figures in the development of Contact Improvisation globally including; Steve Paxton, Kirstie Simson, K.J.Holmes, and Karen Nelson.</span><br />						<span class='fee'>Cost Tuition 195 pounds; Accommodation 60 pounds; All meals 60 pounds (Camping 35; Lunches only 35)</span><br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Helen Macdonald&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: + 44 (0)1342 822238&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "helen.macdonald"						var email2 = "emerson.org.uk"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.emerson.org.uk%3E" target="_blank">www.emerson.org.uk&gt;</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Mar 13 2006]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Aug 22 - 27, 2006</span> <span class='event'>Groundwork ñ a mover's retreat and laboratory</span> <span class='location'>Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>IMMERSE YOURSELF IN NEW MOVEMENT POSSIBILITIES Presented by the North End Dance Co-op: a 5-day infusion of dance, community, creativity and the great outdoors on Nova Scotiaís beautifully rugged Eastern Shore featuring somatic movement, yoga, pilates, contact dance, improvisation and performance.

In our daily lives, we spontaneously weave together body language and spoken words to help us understand and communicate. Logomotion cultivates this synergetic process, and can serve both as a tool for exploring ones thoughts and feelings, and as a medium for performance. The class will include a warm-up practice to awaken our kinetic juices, and timed writings to put us in touch with our wild thoughts and observations. We will focus on improvisation, including movement explorations and exercises for perceptual and compositional awareness. And for developing a natural and intuitive flow between our moving and our speaking, with depth, surprise and delight. Fortiís general approach to the workshop process comes from Anna Halprinís early dance improvisation work of the 1950s and her influence from the Bauhaus School of Design with its emphasis on education through exploration. Fortiís warm up practice includes influences from Anna Halprinís experiential anatomy work with Margaret HíDoubler, from Yang style Tai Chi Chuan which she studied with Marshall Hoío, and from Bonnie Bainbridge Cohenís developmental movement. The warm up will often lead us to inspired dancing that transcends its point of departure.The writing practice comes from Natalie Goldberg as found in her books ìWriting Down the Bonesî and ìWild Mindî. It will consist of writing sessions of about seven minutes, exploring the associations that gather spontaneously around a chosen point of departure.-------- SCOTT SMITH's workshop description: Materials for Movement - Principles, Practice and Contact Improvisation. The workshops begin with warm ups focused on action and release of movement, in relationship to mass, gravity, momentum, falling, recovery, and reflex, to bring a state of flexibility and awareness to dancing. The movement work uses skeletal imaging and action, with particular focus given to the pelvis and spine as root and limb, for extending spherically and dimensionally into space. The material encourages sensation, improvisation, and use of the dancer's own form and action in relationship to the physical world. Research in' Contact improvisations' will provide lens and practice from which to participate in 'partnering' as movement material, encouraging athletic and or sensual physical engagement with other dancers.------------------------------------------------- Organization Zip.Orvietofestival: Caravajal15 residenza dinamica, Via Malabranca 15, 05018 Orvieto (TR) Italy \ info@contactfestival.it \ rossella@contactfestival.it \ www.contactfestival.it \ Tel +39 0763 34 14 79 \ Project assistant Monica Serra monica@contactfestival.it \ tel +39 339 6675800</span><br />						<span class='fee'>The detailed calendar of Zip: hours, lodging logistics, costs, and description of all the workshops, study labs and performances, is still in the process of being defined.

How can we arrive at this state? In this 5 day intensive we will begin by focusing our attention on the details of sensation, cultivating a state of mindfulness. We will work on the skills of receptivity and responsiveness, investigating the landscape of disorientation while building a tolerance for waiting in the unknown. Beginning with the fundamentals of contact improvisation, we will tune into the senses, communicate through touch, weight exchange, moving support, falling safely, and aerial work. Special emphasis during this workshop will be on releasing the neck and pelvis, and surprising ourselves in flight and extended follow-through. Immerse yourself in this 5 day west coast Intensive, dancing 6-7 hours each day, with a half-day in the middle to integrate the material. This intensive is open to all levels of experience and ability.<br />						Martin Keogh has been teaching and performing contact improvisation for over 25 years, in over 62 cities and 15 countries on four continents. He has worked in universities, conservatories, local communities, and professional dance companies. As an independent instructor he has taught intensives, residencies, and master classes with able-bodied, disabled, and visually impaired dancers. He is recognized in the field as a teacher‚Äôs teacher, and as someone who introduces non-dancers to dance using the themes of mythology, race, and gender.

The intention of the workshop is to achieve confidence and freedom with one‚Äôs own material in contact-partnering work and composition. Through games and improvisation, Simone will search for dance material that will later be used for choreographic needs. Focusing on how the quality of this dance material can be varied by changing the intention of execution, the participants will concentrate on many different aspects such as scenic flexibility and presence, sense of own body in space, and creativity. Within this task, Simone will deal with extremes: impulse, speed and silence. Participants will get an idea of global round dance, which is not based on fixed theoretical rules, but on the individual needs of each mind and body. Simone Sandroni was a founding member of Ultima Vez in Brussels in 1987, with which he worked until 1992. He founded and premiered the first choreography with his own group ERNESTO in Brussels in 1993. In addition to directing his own company, he has also directed a number of works for festivals, theatres, independent artists and schools in Belgium, Italy, Canada, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Switzerland. In 1996 he founded the multinational DEJA DONNE dance company, which has performed in 22 European countries, North America and Asia. His recent works PIOTR AND THE STARS OF TUT (2005) and MY NAME IS KING (2006) are currently touring in Europe. In addition to his choreographic work, he leads workshops in Europe and the USA.</span><br />						<br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Klara Kahoutek&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: +49 / 89 / 724 25 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "Klara.Kohoutek"						var email2 = "jointadventures.net"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.jointadventures.net" target="_blank">www.jointadventures.net</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Nov 8 2006]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Dec 13 - 15, 2006</span> <span class='event'>&lt;ARTE, FILOSOF√çA Y SUBJETIVIDAD EN CONTACTO (E) IMPROVISACI√ìN&gt;</span> <span class='location'>Barcelona., Barcelona, Catalunya., Spain.</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>Este trabajo ejercita una mirada y una acci√≥n sobre la relaci√≥n entre arte contemporaneo, cuerpo y subjetividad. Indaga y trabaja algunas cuestiones que estamos investigando sobre esta relaci√≥n, a partir de la pr√°ctica reflexiva de la danza Contact Improvisation (CI). En este taller trabajaremos a partir del CI la posibilidad de reflexionar acerca de los procesos mismos de subjetivaci√≥n (lo que somos capaces de ver y decir sobre lo real). Tratamos aqu√≠ de establecer conexiones entre algunas de las pr√°cticas est√©ticas actuales y los procesos de formaci√≥n del sujeto, a partir de su cuerpo mismo, para actuar sobre las im√°genes y discursos que dan forma a su experiencia est√©tica, y el sentido que produce a partir de ellos. Utilizamos herramientas conceptuales que nos ofrecen las filosof√≠as de la diferencia (G.Deleuze, M.Faucoult, F.Guattari etc) para reflexionar sobre la produccion de subjetividad en la actualidad; as√≠ tambi√©n utilizamos como herramientas ciertos hechos y pr√°cticas art√≠sticas contempor√°neas como son los trabajos y propuestas de artistas pl√°sticos, poetas, m√∫sicos y bailarines. Se abrir√° esta etapa del trabajo de investigaci√≥n que estamos desarrollando con una conferencia en el Departamento d'Arqueologia y Antropologia del Consejo Superior d'Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, el dia 13 de diciembre.

Come develop greater complexity and satisfaction in your dancing, while exploring these questions: How does your desire to ‚Äúdo" create excess tension and effort? How do excess tension and effort interfere with freedom of choice? What happens when you drop excess tension and effort? How does lack of awareness lead you into action and interaction that injures, fatigues and bores you? Can skillfulness replace willfulness? Forget about answers, come dance the questions. Contact Improv Workshop with Karl Frost: This will primarily be a technical workshop, expanding the range of 3-dimensional availablility, power, and ease in the dance...off-balance, inversions, flight, diving, full-bodied moving together into and out of the floor and through the air. The more high-flying techniques will be supported by and balanced with more subtle explorations -- movement looked at in terms of millimeters, examining how we use our bodies and coordinate for greater ease, presence, self-reflection, and delight.</span><br />						<span class='fee'>one 3-day workshop: $125-$250; two 3-day workshops: $225-$450</span><br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Tanya Stotsky&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: 707-407-7566&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "rumblepeg"						var email2 = "synapsiswarehouse.org"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.synapsiswarehouse.org/rumblepeg" target="_blank">www.synapsiswarehouse.org/rumblepeg</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Oct 21 2006]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Jan 8 - 12, 2007</span> <span class='event'>&lt;br /&gt;January CI workshop with Brenton Cheng and Vitali Kononov at MOC</span> <span class='location'>&lt;br /&gt;Oakland, &lt;br /&gt;CA, &lt;br /&gt;USA</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt;: Undefined index: post_eventFullDescription in &lt;b&gt;/home/webadmin/moabjam.com/html/listing/eventListing.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This workshop is designed for all levels participants and is a part of IMPROVISATIONAL MIND &amp; PERFORMANCE module at Moving On Center School of Participatory Arts and Somatic Research.

(JAN 18, 25, FEB 1, 8.) HumilitySwim director Ali Woolwich teaches this quarterly 4-class workshop addressing Contact Improvisation Fundamentals--CI from "square one." Fundamentals for CI include, rather than specific "steps," the core pathways and levels of body awareness required to do this dance form. This workshop is great for 1st time beginners, as well as those who are feeling stuck in intermediate level classes because of gaps in training, those who want a good refresher course or those who want to revisit "beginners mind." Through discussion and dance "trouble-shooting" we'll comprehensively fill in the gaps resulting from infrequent attendance at drop-in classes, lack of jam experience, and/or long timegaps out of CI practice that cause rusty-ness! We will focus this work to find smooth, flowing, tuned-in dances, and sustained creative interest. Each student will get a one-on-one lesson with the instructor to address their specific questions or challenges. Jam etiquette and practice will be included in the material, to help you plug into the CI community and a regular CI practice. The last session will end with a facilitated jam period with experienced guest dancers. LOCATION: Studio Valencia, 455A Valencia @ 16th, San Francisco. Future Session Dates: Spring 07 begins April 5, Summer 07 begins May 31.</span><br />						<span class='fee'>$60-$100 sliding scale. $10 Advance deposit required. Full payment due first class.

We will utilize skills and materials developed from Contact Improvisation, Body-Mind Centering and composition to explore, survey, and compose the social and physical landscapes outside of the context of the dance studio and theater. The workshop breaks assumptions and renews possibilities of why and where art happens expanding our sense of self responsibility and eco-consciousness. Location: The location Earthdance's facilities include: -two large and sunny studios with sprung maple floors and radiant heat -an 1812 renovated farmhouse which comfortably accommodates 28 people -a cabin for quiet, meditative personal retreat -a wood stoked sauna nestled in the woods beside a spring fed quarry -125 acres of woods, stream, trails, and flowering meadows Earthdance invites you for workshops, contact improv jams, personal and group retreats throughout the year. Located within driving distance of New York and Boston, we welcome individuals and groups to create, inspire, relax and heal in the glorious Berkshire hills. Mission Statement Earthdance provides a gathering place that inspires the art and spirit of improvisation. We support and train people at all skill levels to find and develop expression in movement, theater and music. The influence of nature and the ongoing contributions of community members and skilled teachers enliven workshops, jams, peer-led groups, and retreats. A core of residential staff integrates artistic practice with everyday work commitments. http://www.earthdance.net/</span><br />						<span class='fee'>tba</span><br />						<span class='contact'>CONTACT: Wilhemeena&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHONE: USA (413) 634-5678&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMAIL: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[						<!--						// email1 & email2 are the text on either side of your email address's @ sign.						var email1 = "contact"						var email2 = "earthdance.net"						document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email1 + "@" + email2 + ">" + email1 + "@" + email2 + "<\/a>")						// -->						//]]>						</script> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE: <a href="http://www.bodycartography.org" target="_blank">www.bodycartography.org</a></span><br />						<span class='updated'>[Dec 4 2006]</span>					</dd>					<dt>						<span class='date'>Jul 8 - 16, 2007</span> <span class='event'>International Contact Improvisation and Performance Festival</span> <span class='location'>Moscow, Moscow, Russia</span>					</dt>					<dd>						<span class='description'>The Festival "Contact Moscow 2007" will take place from July 8 to 16.
