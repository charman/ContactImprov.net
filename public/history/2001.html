			<dt>Jan 6-7, 2001 <b>START WITH WHERE YOU ARE!</b> Santa Monica CA
			<dd>Improvisation in Performance - Weekend Intensive Caroline Waters, Teacher &amp; Facilitator.
				<p>Start the New Year by participating in a workshop which looks at strategies for excavating material for improvisation in performance. Drawing from the work of Augusto Boal's &quot;Image Theatre&quot; and &quot;Real Time Composition&quot; techniques from the New Dance, we will spend the weekend exploring the relationship between the moving and sounding body. We will see how in a short time we can develop a vocabulary of set and improvised movement scores to use as a resource for performance. We will be looking at ways of crafting the intertextuality of this found material, culminating in a performance on Sunday evening. An open jam will follow. Some experience would be helpful, but the workshop will be an open level and will provide an environment for spontaneity and hardworking fun.</p>
				<p>Workshop Fee: $150 for the two days, $75 deposit needed to hold your space in the workshop. Maximum enrollment is eighteen. For more information and workshop schedule, please contact organizer Sarah Swenson at sarahvox@earthlink.net or 562.439.9010.<br>

			<dt>Jan 12 - 14, 2001 <b>Andrew Harwood Contact Improvisation Workshop</b> Boston, MA
			<dd>Contact Improvisation evolved in the early '70's out of the work of Steve Paxton and a group of postmodern dancers in New York City. Through inverstigations of weight, touch and momentum, contact improvisors learn to relate to their own bodies, each other and audiences in new ways. The practise has deeply affected contemporary dance and been the source of many new understandings with the body, movement, and performance.

			<dt>Jan 15, 2001: <b>Andrew Harwood: Instantaneous Composition</b> Boston MA
			<dd>Workshop for advanced level dancers/improvisors
				<p>As long as I have been performing, I have been improvising. Instantaneous or real time composition is an ongoing artistic process for me for over 25 years now. We will be exploring the basic need to move and express ideas and emotions through the vehicle of our body and mind.</p>
				<p>Through various investigations in improvisation, Contact Improvisation, and chance procedures, we will practice instant inventiveness, refine our sensing skills and develop various compositional strategies which will become the framework for composing solo, duet and group material. A deliciously deep and sensual warm up will entice us into this world.</p>

			<dt>February 3 + 4 and 17 + 18, 2001 <b>West Coast Style </b>Cambridge MA
			<dd>with Martin Keogh. What do you imagine when you hear the phrase &quot;West Coast Style&quot;?
				<p>If you sit and watch at a West coast jam you are likely to see more weight exchange, often with quick changes of roles - the supporter going into flight and the flyer becoming the support. There is a blending of centers that encourages near weightlessness and spontaneous acrobatics. You are also more inclined to see people having an angry dance, a sexual dance or a tearful dance.</p>
				<p>In this workshop we will play with this physicality while asking the question &quot;How do I bring more of myself to the form?&quot;</p>
				<p>We'll explore:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Moving from a base of sensation
					<li>Playing with a more weighted contact point
					<li>Emphasizing a strongly shared center
					<li>Seeking ease in going off balance
					<li>Spending more time in disorientation,
					<li>surprise and extended follow-through
				</ul>
				<p>This workshop is not for beginners. For those with a solid grasp of Contact Improvisation fundamentals.</p>
				<p>This workshop includes four six-hour days, with breaks, over two weekends. Those registering for the entire four-day workshop will be given priority. Tuition: 4 days: $185. First weekend only: $110</p>
				<p>To register send a $60 non-refundable deposit with your phone, address, email, and choice of first weekend or full workshop to:</p>

			<dt>April 12-16, 2001 <b>Carpe Momento</b>near Santa Cruz, CA
			<dd>A laboratory in the TOUCHMONKEY perspective of Contact Improvisation and it's application to performance
				<p>Arriving at performance is an organic process that begins with identifying and practicing the principles that support our movement. We'll gather to exchange and deepen in our personal and common understanding of C.I. and it's performance potential. Open to those with experience in C.I. and an interest in exploring the ability to see and be seen.</p>
				<p>Since 1984, Carolyn Stuart has used C.I. for over 150 performance projects. She is also fascinated with the form as a spiritual practice and how it can inform our performance in daily life as well as artistic expression. Her on-going investigation has revealed a state in which complete autonomy AND continuous union with other occur simultaneously and enhance the well-being of both. This phenomenon is at the heart of the TOUCHMONKEY perspective.</p>
				<p>Location:- Salamander Camp, a charming and conducive setting in the Santa Cruz mountains with hot tub!</p>
				<p>Cost: 4 days $200 - $250 Weekend $120 - $150<br>

				Bring food to eat/share; kitchen facilities available<br>
				Sleeping accomodations in studio or outside under the stars<br>
				Bring sleeping bags/tent &amp; towel for steam-room<br>
				Activities include classes, potluck and evening jam<br>
				Hours: Saturday 12-? Sunday, 10-6
				<p>Materials for Movement with Scott Smith<br>
					The work is informed by exercises intended to cultivate physical and perceptual embodiment and use of the dancers own form, in relationship to their environment. The physical work uses skeletal imaging and movement, with particular focus given to the spine as the root and limb for extending spherically and dimensionally into space. The perceptual work researches the genius of the senses, and the use of the senses for dancing and composition. The purpose of the class work is to extend the participants experience and use of their own body, sensation, and action.<br>
				</p>
				<p>Feldenkrais¨ for Dancers: Impulse, Action, Reaction with Lila Hurwitz<br>Integrating the Feldenkrais Method¨, Authentic Movement, and improvisation to find freedom and increase options in your dancing body. The Feldenkrais Method¨ is a subtle and powerful system of neuromuscular repatterning which evokes changes in range of motion, coordination, muscular tone, and the comfort and efficiency of movement. Learning to recognize habitual movement patterns, you'll discover more comfortable ways to dance in any style. Improve breathing, posture and flexibility, to allow full grace and ease in your dancing. We'll go deep to find rich impulses and encourage creativity and suppleness.<br>

				<p>Sun, 5/20 1:30-5:00 mixed level<br>
					Working developmentally, we continue our research of movement with a partner in the physical forces of gravity and momentum. States of groundedness and buoyancy will bring us into explorations of supporting, flying, and moving from a spherical center. Staying open moment to moment to sensation, feeling, imagination and our environment will bring presence and exciting dancing!</p>

				June 2-3, 2001, Sat. 10-5pm, Sun 11-4pm
				<p>A weekend workshop to drop into the formative as well as the expressive elements in coordination, dancing and improvising. We will begin with developmental movement patterns from Body-Mind Centering which underlie our physical integration in movement. Those who are new to the patterns may discover support and increased internal connections, while those continuing to explore them may deepen connections and increase intention and follow-through. As the patterns facilitate the sensing and integration of our own bodies, they form a foundation in the exploration of contact improvisation and on and outward into space. We will simplify movement pathways, not to reduce, but to clarify the physical specificity born of necessity or of choice. We will cultivate our availability in the act of creation by entering the collective realm of the imaginary.</p>

			<dt>June 4-15, 2001 <b>Zen Monkey Project Summer Intensive</b> Charlottesville, Virginia
			<dd>9:30 a.m.-5 p.m. June 4-15, with an extra week of intensive BMC study with Ray Eliot Schwartz June 18-22<br>
				Cost: $375 for the two weeks, $475 for the three (U.S.)<br>
				<p>Come join Katharine Birdsall, Ray Eliot Schwartz, and members of the Zen Monkey Project for two weeks of Body-Mind Centering, Alexander Technique, Contact Improvisation, Release Technique, Vocabulary, Improvisation, and Public Performance. Stay for an extra week of intensive BMC study for only $100 dollars more.<br>
				</p>
				<p>Since its inception in 1995, the Zen Monkey Project has been consistently exploring the boundaries of somatic movement education and contemporary dance forms. Their style is rigorous, experimental, and alive. Investigating the body, developing dynamic presence, and supporting curiosity are hallmarks of their distinctive synthesis.</p>
				<p>The curriculum will include:<br>
					<b>Body-Mind Centering (BMC):</b> BMC is a creative approach to embodiment and movement re-education. Its principles guide the student on a journey towards understanding the powerful wisdom contained within the substance of the human body as well as how this substance is expressed through fundamental patterns of movement.<br>
					<b>Alexander Technique:</b> We will explore methods of freeing the body/mind from postural sets, thus leading us away from the inertia of habit and towards a way of being with ourselves; one which is responsive rather than than reactive. We will have the opportunity to step out of the technique classes which ask us to approach learning through the repetition of form and into a world which offers refreshment in the everyday movements of standing, sitting, lying down, and squatting. We will also investigate the work of anthropologist Raymond Dart whose developmental movement patterns were adopted by F.M. Alexander. The patterns consider movement from an evolutionary point of view.<br>
					<b>Contact Improvisation:</b> Contact Improvisation is about becoming a conscious mover while creating partnerships with yourself, your environment, and others. Our time will be spent developing the basic principles of the form; with special attention to warming up into the dance, rolling in and out of the floor, following the point of contact, and weight sharing.<br>
					<b>Technique:</b> Daily class integrating comprehensive warm-ups, phrases, and dynamic movement through space.<br>
					<b>Vocabulary:</b> We will use several methods to create individual, original dancing languages. These include Authentic Movement, writing, recognition of content during improvisation, building phrases from dynamic physical states, and using text and/or music as source material.<br>
					<b>Improvisation</b>: How do we balance the internal focus of kinesthetic experience with a generous and fully aware sense of what is going on around us? Particular attention will be paid to differentiating &quot;behaving&quot; from &quot;composing&quot;. We will gain experience in qualitative variance as well as the ability to make clear choices in relation to content, time, and space.<br>
					<b>Public Performance:</b> Students will have an opportunity to present work to the Charlottesville community made prior to or during the workshop on the final weekend in a &quot;loft&quot; style performance space with basic technical support.<br>

				Sunday, June 10, 10AM-4PM, $60<br>
				Shotwell Studio, 3252-A 19th St., San Francisco
				<p><b><i>If you could do Aikido, surf, wrestle and dance at the same time, you would have an idea of what Contact Improvisation feels like.</i></b></p>
				<p>Contact Improvisation is unpredictable by nature and requires being in the moment and letting go of preconceived notions of how to move. What makes Contact Improvisation different from other dance is that partners are often moving in and out of physical contact while rolling, spiraling, springing and falling. They find ways to &quot;enjoy the ride&quot; and improvise while mutually supporting and following each otherâs movements. The dancing can be dynamic and action packed or gentle and quiet. The form and rhythm of the dancing is inspired by the physical and energetic contact the partnersâ share.</p>
				<p>Ernie Adams is a dancer with over twenty years teaching experience, including extensive touring in the US and Europe, with Mangrove (1977-81) and Umbrella for the Performing Arts (1982-86). Since 1986, he has been developing an integration of Contact Improvisation with bodywork and somatic education. and has been a Certified Feldenkrais Practitionercm since 1993.</p>

			<dd>
				<p>Three Weeks of *Intensive Training* in Contact Improvisation.</p>
				<p></p>
				<div align="center">
					* THE CONTENT *</div>
				<p></p>
				<p>To develop confidence in our common vocabulary we will begin by reviewing the essentials of Contact Improvisation. These include: tuning the senses, communicating through touch, weight exchange , moving support, falling safely, and aerial work. There will be special emphasis on releasing the neck and pelvis, and surprising ourselves in flight and extended follow-through.</p>
				<p>From this bedrock of skills we will investigate improvising that arises directly from physical sensation. We will use scores to expand and integrate our improvisational choice-making to include: bringing the many facets of ourselves into the improvisation; development of relationships; playing with musicality; and using imagery and imagination to inform and embody the dance. We will play with discarding conventions and jumping off into the unknown together.</p>
				<p>To support the development of our skills there?¥ä will be opportunities for giving and receiving feedback within the structure of practice sessions, discussion groups, and labs.</p>
				<p></p>
				<div align="center">
					* THE FORMAT *</div>
				<p></p>
				<p>We will work together five hours a day, five days a week. Other activities will include jams, potlucks, and other spontaneous surprises.</p>
				<p>We want to get to know you, your treasures, your idiosyncrasies, your distinctive pathways into the Contact form. Attending a three week training allows the group to establish working relationships, and provides the opportunity for everyone to create significant changes in their dancing.</p>
				<p>***Because of the advanced nature of this workshop, this intensive is for those with a solid grasp of Contact fundamentals.***</p>
				<p>Martin Keogh and Ray Chung bring distinct and complementary approaches to the Contact form. Ray creates an environment of curiosity that guides the senses to the material of improvisation. Martin enlivens the space with games and metaphors. They have been performing and teaching for over twenty years and share a long history of collaboration and a desire to see people excel in their dance.</p>

			<dd>Intensive Workshop (4 days) in Contact Improvisation<br>
				For those with a solid grasp of Contact fundamentals. (Limited participants)<br>
				<p>Amidst the velocity and whirling of a hurricane rests an area that is silent and still, known as the ãeye.ä Cultivating this quiet core at the center of activity is the theme of this workshop. We will settle into a base camp of mindfulness, and then set out to investigate the wilderness of disorientation. We will enter the forest where there's no trail, jump into the dark, swim into what might be a cave, and build a tolerance for waiting in the unknown. Special emphasis on releasing the neck and pelvis, and surprising ourselves in flight and extended follow-through.</p>
