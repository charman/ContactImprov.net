					</dt>
					<dd>
						Action Theater is an improvisation form that strengthens the embodiment and expression of presence. In this 2nd annual East Coast intensive, participants will engage in techniques developing and integrating movement, acting, voice, composition, listening and relationship. Behavior is repeatedly dismantled and reconfigured, and the participant ultimately has no choice but to let go. Dancers experience the feeling and movement of speech; actors let their bodies participate; all discover new possibilities for self-expression and presence.

							Ruth, internationally known for her work in physical theater improvisation, teaches throughout the US, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy and Israel. She is a two-time recipient of National Endowment for the Arts Choreography Fellowship. <font size="-1"><i>[17 Jan 1999]</i></font>

						</table>Exploring Improvisational Movement Performance as a Necessarily Paradoxical Experience : Performance as Presenting / Sharing the "process" Being and Transcending One' Self.
						<p>
							focused on: Presence &amp; Awareness in the Expression of Multi-leveled/Integrated Process and Clarity/Ease of Movement. Integrating : Contact Improvisation / Releasing Technique / the Feldenkrais Method and other neuro-muscular-skeletal techniques.
						</p>
						<p>
							ROBERT FUNK and CATHERINE DUNCAN have performed and taught dance, movement and bodywork throughout the US and Canada. They began exploring Contact Improvisation in the mid 70's and have been instrumental in developing and supporting the work ever since. Both are trained in teaching Skinner Releasing Technique. Robert, a Feldenkrais practitioner, has practiced and taught bodywork since the late 60s. They integrate dance with their extensive experience in movement and verbal therapy, bodywork and other personal growth modalities. They have participated as dancers, hosts and educators in countless performances and forums to investigate, make conscious and refine the "process" creating improvisational work. Contact and Releasing are at the heart of their lives. Respect, mindfulness and "a willingness not to know" central in their work.

					</dt>
					<dd>
						The circumstances for this residency are unique. Up to twenty artists are invited to commission a solo that Hay will choreograph and teach over the course of two weeks. But unlike typical business exchange between two people, this residency is based on involving a larger community in the creation of art. The commissioning fee must not come from the performer's private resources. The performer must find sponsorship from relatives, friends, and local arts organizations for the commissioning fee, thereby supporting the artist's development while paying for the creation of art. A public performance will conclude the residency.
						<p>
							Deborah Hay's orientation to dance is activated by attention to practice of performance. In an intense learning environment she challenges the experienced performer with movement concepts that trigger multiple levels of perception at once. Hay's approach 'choreographs' the world between moments where movement proclivity plays second fiddle to exercised inquiry. <font size="-1"><i>[17 Jan 1999]</i></font>

						with Birgit Raven Ruttkowski.
						<p>
							When we honor landscapes as the source of our movement material, we open the gates to our own naturalness, to the water, earth, wind, fire and void within and throughout spirit. By pledging creation our attentions, by listening to the common heartbeat, we open ourselves fully to the beauty of the Earth so we are able to step through the flimsy veil and walk through the illusion of separation to remember those elements alive and vibrant inside ourselves; the cadence of the water, the currents of the air playing in a treetop, the textures of the earth against our fingers, the dance of an open fire in the night, the silences between our heratbeat. We become present, realigning to and re-energizing our oneness to all that is, ever was, and will be, nourish and revive our dance therefore our dance of life.
						</p>
						<p>
							We will work in the studio as well as in the beautiful parks of Potsdam, developing our first sequences and choreographies, which will be improved to be presented the last day.

						an intermediate level intensive in Contact Improvisation with Debra Bluth &amp; Patrick Crowley
						<p>
							A workshop for those with comfortable experience in the fundamentals. We will be investigating the particulars of our anatomy to increase the richness of how we inhabit our bodies. From this we will see how states of mind and movement emerge. How can we take luscious, physical risks without it feeling risky? Some of what we'll explore: diving from the kidneys, rotating and inverting from the coccyx, playing with how we experience vision in relationship to the spine, and surrendering to disorientation in the mind while grounding through the body. With succulent and full-bodied contact with the earth and our partners, we will experiment with being completely committed and non-attached in our improvising.
