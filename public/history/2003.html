Principles from release technique and martial arts will be integrated to work on movement into and out of the floor w/ and w/o a partner, alignment and architecture, weight sharing, lifting and being lifted (principles and vocabulary), flight, easeful pathways, following and channeling the flow of momentum, physical listening, the balance of intention and detachment, and allowing surprise and the unpredicted while staying present and aware.<br />						Afternoons (12-3) Contact Practice and Poetics The afternoons will open up our sense of poetry in motion, both in terms of experience and performance. We integrate our always evolving sense of contact with the larger dance of image, composition, creation/discovery, and sensorial play.

This year's Improvisation Intensive will include study of contact improvisation/release technique, composition and perceptual awareness and Yoga, while tasty homemade food will nourish our bodies. Through Yoga we will use the principles of sthira (alert and awake) and sukha (comfortable and relaxed) to connect us to our vibrant core. Through improvisational dance we will examine how to connect to our deep well of personal imagery, finding the strength of one's own presence and inner stillness as a source of inspiration and realizing the expression of our multifaceted being. In contact, we will focus attention on the details of sensation and work on skills of receptivity and responsiveness. Integrating these three approaches we will awaken our dancing, open our aesthetic palette and find new sources from which to draw. The daily schedule will include a warm-up, two class sessions and a jam session. The day will be divided as follows: Morning Yoga with Alicia Grayson Afternoon Contact with Martin Keogh Afternoon Composition and Perceptual Awareness with Cyrus Khambatta After dinner jam Group discussions will further investigation of the material covered (See article by Cyrus in May issue of CQ for example of subject matter).<br />						COST: $465 (includes food, lodging and class fee - $100 deposit due by July 31st) Travel is not included but rides can be arranged with others coming from the nearby cities of Washington D.C.
