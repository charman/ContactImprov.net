						January 22-23, 2000: <b>SENSING COMPOSITION/COMPOSING SENSATION: An improvisation workshop</b> Berlin
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Sensing Composition/Composing Sensation introduces material developed by Lisa Nelson and Image Lab, including the Single Image score and the Tuning score: simple, profound and creative tools for illuminating dance-making. We will luxuriously explore our senses of sight, hearing, and touch -- as well as our "sixth sense," our sense of our own weight in gravity -- through solo research, partnering and group dancing. The Single Image score, a lens for looking at the elements of a dance event, and the Tuning Score, in which players direct the improvisation from within using verbal calls, will help us organize our sensations and perceptions into dynamic composition.
						<p>
							Sensing Composition/Composing Sensation is open to curious people of all backgrounds and abilities. The workshop may be of special interest to improvisers wishing to deepen or expand their practices, to choreographers looking for new compositional tools, to performers who want to add dimension to their stage presence, or to beginners interested in starting somewhere. Taught in English by Sherry Cohen.

							"The work of the BodyCartopgraphy Project validates the experience of my body, what I feel and sense in the present moment, in the environment I live and play in. It allows for critical, spiritual and art making dialogue around these issues with others, participant and public alike. Together we create a sustainable responsuble art making structure ( in the face of corporate abuse) that is invested in the relationship between our bodies, our communities and the environment."

We will touch back into the basic Contact principles and sensations to simplify and challenge our play with the forces, with each other, and to stimulate new depth in our personal expression. We will study and feel how forms arise in the improvisation, how to identify and pursue them, and how the dancing, while rooted in a deep physical sensitivity, can articulate the serendipitous nature of form, feeling, and imagination.<br />

											at the Freehold Theater, Oddfellows Building, Seattle<br />
											Contact Improvisation is a 28 year old artsport concerned with the possibilities of bodies in contact. An anarchist dance with no rules but with many years of accumulated and divergent experience, practices, and techniques. It is simultaneously a dance form and a physical practice. The Saturday workshop is an overview and integration of the fundamentals of contact improvisation presented both as an introduction for the beginner and a deepening into practice for the more experienced contacter -- an exploration of some of the more common elements of a contact dance

											at the Seattle Mime Theater, Oddfellows Building, Seattle<br />
											$30 ($40 for Saturday and Sunday)<br />
											Release approaches to dynamic and unpredictable partnering work in improvisation and composition. Integrating contact and partnering into a kinesthetically based improvisation. By considering the partner as just another part of the dynamic environment, we learn to stay present in our own dance while making contact. That is, we stay present with our own experience and intentions while acknowledging and working with the interplay of another body in the space or in contact. The ideas of manipulation, surrender, and resistance will help shape our interaction and focus our intentions. We will also work on the concept of passive sequencing of momentum through and between bodies as an avenue into ease and fluidity. Looking at dance as a form of physical theater, we explore contact in relation to kinesthesia, feeling, and narrative as well as the more abstract elements of perceived space, time, and shape. Previous ci and improvisation experience assumed

										Dec 18, 2001 <b>Audition/class with Karl Frost</b> Seattle

									<dd>
										Seattle Mime Theater, Oddfellows Building, Seattle looking for a handful of dancers from around BC and the Northwest. The project will focus on dynamic and unpredictable partnering work and will be a mixture of improvisation and choreography. It will involve a 3 week intensive rehearsal process on remote Lasqueti Island in BC. Performances TBA, most likely on Lasqueti and in Vancouver, Victoria, and Seattle. looking for dynamic and athletic dancers with a sense of daring, flow, and release who are comfortable with improvisation and contact work. Years of experience not as essential as chutzpah and ease. The work will focus less on muscle work than on finding speed and flight through release and channelling momentum. No pay, but food and lodging covered on an incredibly beautiful rural island, plus great training in contact. Rehearsal dates TBA, most likely late July/early August. Even if you don't want to be in the piece but just want to check out the class, feel free to come. The audition will be in the form of a class: an hour of warm-up and exploration of principles followed by a two hour series of tricks and partnering sequences of increasing difficulty. It'll be a lot of fun! Karl Frost has been practicing and performing contact improvisation and interdisciplinary, dance-based performance since the mid 80s. His physical work is influenced on the one hand by modern release technique and on the other by his study of martial arts (capoeira and hapkido). He is known internationally for his dynamic movement style and for the edge-pushing, experimental nature of his work, both in process and performance. His performing and teaching has been showcased across N and S America, Europe, and Australia. He is the director of the Dancing Wilderness Project, an ongoing investigation into the interrelationships amongst wilderness experience, body-based creative process, and how we live our lives. He is part of the interdisciplinary experiment, Onionoak, based on Lasqueti Island.<br />
