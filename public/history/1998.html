						<b>Contact and Improvisation:</b> A one-day workshop where we will focus on various ways of using CI as part of a larger repertoire or pallette a focus on ensemble and performing.

						Feb 14-16, 1998: <b>Crash Course</b> Karl Frost SF, CA, USA
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<blockquote>
							This workshop is about the more dynamic side of contact improvisation: acrobatics and speed in the context of released and easeful dancing. We will work on the skills of lifting, flying, falling, and physical listening through the exploration of both general principles and a wide variety of particular lifts. We will cultivate a comfort and excitement with the unknown. Explorations in the dynamic use of alignment will allow us to let go of muscling mass and turn our energy towards speed and three-dimensional movement. Release, while promoting efficiency and <i>healthier, safer dancing</i>, will lead us deeper into the unexpected. We will do bodywork with each other as a tool to promote easier movement and to increase our sensitivity to each other's moving bodies. Letting go with our heads and allowing the information to sink into our bodies, we will turn the dance into a mediatation in the flow of momentum and mass through space. We will sweat a lot.

						Oct 9-11, 1998: <b>Dance on Sound</b>, Vashon Island, WA
					</dt>
					<dd>
						A live-in, hands-on workshop with Karen Nelson, Scott Smith, and Joan Hanna. Dance on Sound is an environment for integrating dance, music, nature &amp; community. Improvisation is encouraged &amp; nurtured through the study of movement techniques ranging from Contact Improvisation to Material for the Spine to contemplative dance to compositional approaches in a music-friendly living space. In this 3rd year of our evolving project, the schedule will have some flexibility, reflecting the needs of the group. We will live &amp; work with a small group &amp; explore the healing aspects of Hanna's private residence, a pristine setting on the shores of the Puget Sound. We will prepare a collective feast for our senses &amp; make time to give to our artistic processes. Arrive Friday night for jamming and hanging out. Saturday we'll have two long classes and a jam at night. Sunday morning we'll have one long class. Workshop fee: $60-75 includes shared indoor sleeping spaces or tent space, food, steam bath, beach access, &amp; the workshop. Simple meals will be created &amp; shared by everyone. You're welcome to come to the whole weekend or just a day -- $25 per class, $5-10 per jam. Limited enrollment; early registration suggested.
