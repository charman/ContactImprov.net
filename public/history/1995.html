				<h4>
					What is Contact Improvisation?
				</h4>I've never seen a definition of Contact that I really liked. For some people, it's a (new) folk dance. For others, it's a process for finding new choreographic ideas. Some people perform it, others do it as a practise or discipline. Some people look at it and see gymnastics, or wrestling, or swing dance. What are the "mere facts" about it? It's usually done as a duet (but sometimes solo or in larger groups), it's usually in silence; and it's improvised. Dancers are as likely to be on the floor as standing, and sometimes they're flying on someone else's shoulders. (I really should get some photographs.)
				<p>
					The single best place to find out more, short of just doing it, is in the pages of <a href="1995.html#cq">Contact Quarterly</a>, a magazine that covers contact and the extended family of new dance.
				</p>
				<h4>
					What's this page for?
				</h4>
				<p>
					My intention is to use it as a referral service for jams, workshops, classes and events. I don't see a need for an online magazine or journal for Contact, since we're already well served by the Quarterly. On the other hand I'd like to have a couple of photographs, and maybe even a video clip. In a couple of years, when there's more bandwidth available on the net, we can try setting up live connections between jams.

					This list is exceedingly short. A full list appears in each issue of CQ, but I did not copy it because it seems to me that when people send in their names to CQ, they are not necessarily agreeing to put their names up on the Internet. I've sent a letter to CQ asking people to tell me what they think. In the meantime, if you want to be listed, send email to me. This listing for now is alphabetic by last name. If it gets bigger I'll use something else, or add a search facility.
