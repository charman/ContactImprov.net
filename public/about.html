This definition is here only for the sake of those who are surfing the Web and stumbled onto this page. Those of you already doing CI may as well go back.				</p>				<p>					I've never seen a definition of Contact that I really liked. For some people, it's a post-modern folk dance. For others, it's a process for finding new choreographic ideas. Some people perform it, others do it as a practise or discipline. Some people look at it and see gymnastics, or wrestling, or swing dance. What are the "mere facts" about it? It's usually done as a duet (but sometimes solo or in larger groups), it's usually in silence; and it's improvised. Dancers are as likely to be on the floor as standing, and sometimes they're flying on someone else's shoulders. You might want to see the <a href="photos/">photographs and videos</a> for some examples.				</p>				<p>					The single best place to find out more, short of just doing it, is in the pages of <a href="http://www.contactquarterly.com/">Contact Quarterly</a>, a magazine that covers contact and the extended family of new dance. A good, recent, and (comparatively) easy to find book is <i>Sharing the Dance</i> by Cynthia Bull Novack. See also the <a href="biblio.html">bibliography of contact improvisation</a> collected at CI25.				</p>				<h3>					What is Contact Improvisation? <i>by Ernie Adams</i>				</h3>				<p>					Contact Improvisation is a moving massage. It is a dance that fine tunes your senses and wakes up your ability to listen and respond to what is happening in the moment. If you could do Aikido, surf, wrestle and dance at the same time, you would have an idea of what Contact Improvisation feels like. What makes Contact different from other dance is that partners are often moving in and out of physical contact while rolling, spiraling, springing and falling. They find ways to "enjoy the ride" and improvise while mutually supporting and following each others movements. The dancing is unpredictable and inspired by the physical and energetic contact the partners share.				</p>				<p>					Ernie Adams, Berkeley, CA, email: enadams at movementpathways dot com				</p>				<p>					Return to <a href="index.html">ContactImprov.net</a>				</p>		<!--#include virtual="/includes/footer.html"-->	</body></html>
