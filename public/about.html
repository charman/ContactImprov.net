				<h3>
					What is Contact Improvisation?
				</h3>
				<p>
					There are many possible definitions of Contact.  Here is an early one from Nancy Stark Smith:
				</p>
				<div style="padding-left: 2em;">
					<p>
						Contact Improvisation is a dance form, originated by American 
						choreographer Steve Paxton in 1972, based on the communication between 
						two or more moving bodies that are in physical contact and their combined 
						relationship to the physical laws that govern their motion—gravity, momentum, inertia.
					</p>

					<p>
						The body, in order to open to these sensations, must learn to release excess 
						muscular tension and abandon a certain quality of willfulness to experience 
						the natural flow of movement. Practice includes rolling, falling, being upside 
						down, following a physical point of contact, supporting and giving weight to a partner.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Contact improvisations are spontaneous physical dialogues that range from stillness 
						to highly energetic exchanges. Alertness is developed in order to work in an energetic 
						state of physical disorientation, trusting in one’s basic survival instincts. It is a 
						free play with balance, self-correcting the wrong moves and reinforcing the right ones, 
						bringing forth a physical/emotional truth about a shared moment of movement that leaves 
						the participants informed, centered, and enlivened.
