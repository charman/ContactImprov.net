    <td>New York 1972, in an inner city loft, in parks and in the 
      streets, Steve Paxton's dance company including Nancy Stark Smith devised 
      a style of movement that came to be known as Contact Improvisation. Early 
      May this year, Nancy Stark Smith spent a four day long weekend in Melbourne. 
      On the Friday she coordinated a day long jam at the Cecil St Studio. It 
      was attended by dancers from Melbourne and Sydney. We watched, listened 
      to, and danced with this woman who has played a key role in the creation 
      and subsequent development of Contact Improvisation. The atmosphere was 
      light: people may have come expecting a class however Nancy made it apparent 
      that primarily we were there to enjoy ourselves, and each others company. 
      Then along the way all this conspired to remind us just how much this form 
      has enriched our lives. On the following Sunday I spoke to Nancy on the 
      phone. From Brunswick to a beach house in Anglesea, this is a transcript 
      of what was said. </td>

  <dt><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do you recall as initially 
    the most striking thing about CI?</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <br>
    </font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dancing in this way was very new 
    for me, in an artistic context and as a physical experience. Communication 
    and relational aspects were very powerful... I think the combination of innovative 
    dancing with full blown and very vigorous movement and interaction was very 
    exciting for me. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>Did you find aspects of the movement confronting? </i></font>
  <dd> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Well, actually the whole experience that first couple of weeks, we lived together 
    in a loft in New York, and ate and danced together, all our beds in one big 
    room, and I hadn't done that before... </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>How old were you then? </i></font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    I was 19, or maybe I was already 20. Id been a college student and I was still 
    living at home; the sixties, Woodstock and that kind of thing was happening 
    so it wasn't unknown, but, that whole way of 24 hour engaged being with people. 
    Dancing, eating dinner, watching the videotape, having dreams...it was a total 
    immersion experience. It was very exciting, but it was also a discipline. 
    </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
    Was any part of it, the movement or the situation, particularly confronting 
    or difficult? </i></font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    No, I didn't experience it that way. It was exciting and new - of course in 
    that kind of situation you're up against yourself. There were certainly people 
    in the group that I had greater difficulty meeting in the physical conversation 
    - people whose movement backgrounds were quite different from mine. So to 
    bridge those differences took a little bit more time and understanding and 
    it did happen. But, yeah, I mean I just felt very wide eyed during the whole 
    thing. I didn't experience much inhibition, more recognising I had a lot to 
    learn and that I was in an unknown place. I really trusted Steve, I was very 
    excited, and I wanted to be there so...We have this thing called suspending 
    your disbelief, I think I definitely did that (laughs). </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>A bit of a trust experience?</i> </font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    I didn't feel like &quot;this was a trust experience&quot; like a vision quest, 
    or walking on fire. Just this sense that I did trust Steve as an artist and 
    as a director of this process. We were all very excited. There was a group 
    of intelligent dancers - so we were all making sense of it as we went along 
    and learning by doing it. It wasn't about doing anything right, we were invited 
    into a process, and we weren't sure how long that process would go on - initially 
    it was two weeks. At first I was going to stay with my parents but I quickly 
    found out it was a total 24 hour a day kind of experience you know, sometimes 
    we'd rehearse in the park sometimes in the loft...the food that we ate, the 
    preparation, all of the exchange...watching video a lot, long hours of dancing 
    - that kind of immersion... An intense process. It was, yeah it was. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>Ok. What is it about Contact that has kept you continually inspired for 
    all these years? </i></font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    I don't find any other activity that touches on so many aspects of my interests 
    as Contact. I have other studies and other ways of working and training that 
    I like, that are feeding into my practice. But I think the exploration of 
    how to find the next bit of learning and the next understanding and the next 
    expression, to find the freedom within, what is possible for you and to feel 
    the edges of that understanding physically and conceptually, to feel what 
    are the next questions and to pursue them. It just seems to keep happening 
    for me. Just at this point I think I'm kind of understanding completely my 
    way of contact, and there is some pleasure in that, in doing it. Every dance 
    is different, so there's newness there, but then, each level of understanding 
    leads you on to the next, you're then moving towards that, so it just keeps 
    going somehow. It makes sense that you want to accomplish something, and that 
    you want to achieve a level of competency, but I think beyond that is learning 
    how to find the new questions, the new challenges, physically and conceptually. 
    And to invent forms and ways of exploring those and going towards those. As 
    a process it seems to work. I mean some of my explorations might indeed have 
    techniques slightly out of the definition of Contact Improvisation and I don't 
    feel that detracts from my work. I feel that as a process, because it is my 
    central practice that I keep coming back and working with, that as new information 
    and understanding comes to me from any direction it will change my way of 
    being in this practice, so it opens new territory there again. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>What do you think is the most exciting thing about Contact in performance 
    from your perspective as an audience member?</i> </font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    I think that the raw physicality, and the transparency of that, that people 
    can actually see real bodies with real weight relating to the forces. The 
    physical forces, and be exposed to them and grapple with them, and grapple 
    with each other on a physical level, and a nervous system level. There is 
    a tremendous amount of transmission of that kind of communication from seeing 
    it. A kinaesthetic transmission. It can turn people on to their own bodies. 
    Seeing human nature manifested in micro version in the dancers, the movement 
    the pauses the excitement the dilemmas, thrills, virtuosity. All of that you 
    can see in a very non linear, and not particularly narrative form. And I think 
    people will see what they're interested in seeing. They can see a love affair 
    they can see a fight, it's quite an open book in terms of how to look at it 
    and what to get out of it. But I do think the kinaesthetic transmission is 
    pretty strong. I find that even in more traditional pieces when modern dance 
    choreographers incorporate aspects of Contact Improvisation into their partnering 
    for the post modern work, I do feel a palpable difference in the audience 
    when the dancers are touching and when they're exchanging weight. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>Ok...are you still performing?</i> </font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Oh yeah. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>What then is the most exciting thing for you as a performer? </i></font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Well, that transparency is also true for both sides. And when I can achieve 
    a level of communication with an audience. The feeling that you're offering 
    a genuine experience to an audience - not hiding it from them, or forcing 
    it on them. That puts us in the same environment, and it creates a positive 
    exchange. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
    Where is your focus when you're performing? </i></font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    There are a lot of levels of focus going on. It's very rare to do a straight 
    on Contact duet as a performance. It does happen and I'm enjoying it more 
    at the moment. Usually you find a more ensemble improvisational context with 
    more ideas going on and not just Contact...but generally I'm noticing my own 
    sensations, I'm feeling what my partners movement is generating on a sensational 
    and a physical level in terms of timing and textures, and those start to add 
    up in some way. Then again it can be a moment to moment situation where nothing 
    adds up. I think it's an awareness as an artist of ones own aesthetic and 
    compositional perceptions. How I might enjoy playing with my inward sensations, 
    playing the music of it. I tend not to, well, I'm aware of visibility, not 
    in the sense of trying to control what an audience sees, it's an interesting 
    situation to be in, to have a front-on audience and be practicing a spherical 
    form. I just want to be engaged in what I'm doing and know that people can 
    see. And feel the energy of an audience and be able to add that into what 
    I'm doing. I'm tracking my own engagement. If I feel my own attention or engagement 
    flag, then really my job is to be fully engaged. The importance isn't totally 
    so much what I'm doing, but how I'm doing what I'm doing. </font>
  <dt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <i>Alright, last question. How has your practice of Contact informed the rest 
    of your life?</i> </font>
  <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Mmm, good question. I suppose a lot wouldn't it be. Every dance you have puts 
    you, I think, in the sort of body time that we talked about on Friday. You're 
    getting a very direct and sort of holographic reflection and transmission 
    from your partner,to your partner,off of your partner, and there's certain 
    truths on all those levels, some that are repeated, some that are unique and 
    they add up. You see the same principles apply to the rest of your life in 
    relation to people and your environment. I remember a basic example early 
    on when we were spending all day falling and rolling and listening with each 
    other in the loft, and then you get out on the street and seeing all the possible 
    relationships. So you know, we were swinging on parking meters and falling 
    over benches. It just seems so arbitrary that we just walk along, and you 
    know all the other possible relationships to gravity and the objects in the 
    world seem so arbitrarily limited. But I even find that if I'm dancing in 
    a club and my body goes off centre more than a 45 degree-angle people find 
    that threatening, that animal survival instinct, people think something's 
    wrong. Not to mention falling or being upside down. People just aren't used 
    to it. There is a desire to make connections. It goes both ways. The lessons 
    I learn and the phenomenon in Contact are a metaphor or model for the rest 
    of my life, and vice versa. When I learn things in life they come into my 
    dancing as well. </font>
