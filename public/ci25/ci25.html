					<h1>
						Welcome to CI 25
					</h1>
					<h2>
						CONTACT IMPROVISATION's<br />
						25th Anniversary Celebration
					</h2>
				</center>
				<p>
					The Contact Jubilee is over, but leaves traces in cyberspace (not to mention the bodies and minds of those who participated.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The 25th Anniversary Issue of Contact Quarterly is being made immediately following the event. Any submissions on the topic of Contact and its 25 years can be sent to CQ: P.O. Box 603, Northampton, MA 01061, by JULY 1st. (Later reflections and findings can still be sent to CQ but may be too late to be considered for the issue. Don't hesitate to send!)
				</p>
				<p>
					We'll be continuing to collect CONTACT TEACHER'S IDEA LOG entries beyond CI25. If you haven't contributed yet, are willing to do more, and/or would be willing to pass them on to other teachers, please pick up blanks in the Reference Room before you leave and send them to NSS at CQ.
				</p>
				<p>
					We intend to make a book about the history and experience of Contact Improvisation and will be collecting material over the next year or two for this project. It will include materials from the CI25 Resource Room archives as well as current writings, photography and artwork. We are interested in people's ideas for essays and other writings and graphics. Please contact the following people with your ideas: Julie Carr: 718.935.0935 and email jqc9448@is4.nyu.edu Nancy Stark Smith at CQ (address above) tel. (413) 586-1181; 586-8243 (h); Ann Cooper Albright (216.775.0790); Dena Davida (514.844.5675); Martin Keogh (524.152.0822)
				</p>
				<p>
					Jennifer Keller is compiling a chronology of events in CI as part of a CD ROM project. If you have any info about names and dates of historic events that you feel should be included, please call Jennifer (412.363.5245 or email jckel@imap1.asu.edu). You can send finished material anytime to CI25 Book, c/o CQ, P.O. Box 603, Northampton, MA 01061.
