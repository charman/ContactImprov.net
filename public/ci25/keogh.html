				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the range of touching and being touched
					</li>
					<li>for the reverence dancing with men and the rapture dancing with women

					<li>for getting to be around (and around) such wonderful bodies
					</li>
					<li>for being my living, my support, my lively-hood
					</li>
					<li>for often inspiring humility by how inclusive and magnanimous you are
					</li>
					<li>for being such a spontaneous yet consistent partner
					</li>
					<li>for keeping me so close to the worlds of paradox and mystery
					</li>
