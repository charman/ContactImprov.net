	<h1>A Birthday Card for Contact Improvisation</h1>
	Dear C.I.,
	<p>Here's a list of 25 gifts you've given me:</p>
	<p>Thank you for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a network of companions all over the world
		<li>for resisting definition, codification and doctrine
		<li>for not making us dress up
		<li>for the desire and discipline of the practitioners to bring language to this dance form
		<li>for not being trendy
		<li>for a strong and supple body
		<li>for many good C.I. performances, and some bad ones
		<li>for the adrenelinnnnnnnnne
	</ul>
	<p>Thank you for:</p>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>the generosity of the people who teach this form
		<li>for not having to learn any steps
		<li>for the challenge of dancing with people of all different abilities, including those in wheelchairs and the blind
		<li>for being fertile ground for metaphor
		<li>for being a dance inclusive of regional, temporal and personal variations
		<li>for the friends, colleagues and lovers
		<li>for deepening our capacity for pleasure
		<li>for always being an incomplete form- so people can complete it with themselves
	</ul>
	<p>Thank you for:</p>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>the range of touching and being touched
		<li>for the reverence dancing with men and the rapture dancing with women
		<li>for not having certifications, belts, diplomas, ranks, and hazing initiations
		<li>for the laughter
		<li>for getting to be around (and around) such wonderful bodies
		<li>for being my living, my support, my lively-hood
		<li>for often inspiring humility by how inclusive and magnanimous you are
		<li>for being such a spontaneous yet consistent partner
		<li>for keeping me so close to the worlds of paradox and mystery
	</ul>
	<p>Happy 25th Birthday C.I. I love you,</p>
