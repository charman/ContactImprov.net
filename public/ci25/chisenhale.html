					CONTACT 25<br />
					Chisenhale Dance Space, London<br />
					20 Sept-30 Nov 1997
				</h1>Contact 25 celebrates twenty five years of contact improvisation - its current diversity and future possibilities. Chisenhale's programme of events seeks to examine the breadth and vitality of a constantly evolving dance form, and its fertile partnerships with other improvisation and bodywork techniques.
				<p>
					The season features guest artists from Britain, Europe and the USA who will teach and perform, including Steve Paxton, the original pioneer; Klein Technique specialists Barbara Mahler and Jeremy Nelson from New York; American performer Chris Aiken; and Benno Voorham from Sweden.
				</p>
				<p>
					Workshops will explore contact in relation to improvised performance, Alexander, Body Mind Centering and disability. Commissioned performances by British-based artists draw on both contact improvisation and other improvisational roots; and a one-day conference on 23 November will debate how contact can develop in the changing contexts of the next century. Guest speakers are Mary Prestidge, Steve Paxton and Kevin Finnan, and there will also be a chance to see Paxton performing.
