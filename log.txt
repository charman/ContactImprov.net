THIS COMMIT:

absolute paths properly because of a missing protocol prefix, e.g.:

confusing

@ Update HTML
  - fix titles

     margin

@ Create Google sitemap

@ Google search box for site

@ Cache Entry list pages (/entries/list and /home/index)

@ When destroying an (*)Entry, the attached models are not deleted

@ email notification when Entry is modified
  - show what fields have changed

@ If someone goes to /#{entry_type}/edit instead of
/#{entry_type}/edit/ID, display a page listing all of the events that
they can edit for that type of entry

@ How to write automated tests that check if caching is working?

@ Refactor auto-complete location actions to separate controllers

==[ LOG ]=============================================================

----[ day, January , 2009 ]--------------------------------------



----[ Monday, December 14, 2009 ]-------------------------------------

@ Found this sample code for implementing tabbed windows using the
Google Maps API v3 with jQuery:

  http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infowindow/tabs.html



----[ Monday, January 26, 2009 ]--------------------------------------

@ Added a cron script:

  /etc/cron.daily/mysqldump_cq_rails

to back up the ci_rails MySQL database daily.


----[ Saturday, January 24, 2009 ]------------------------------------

@ Fixed a bug in my caching code were the cache wasn't being flushed
when modifying a non-US entry.

Since memcached is not flushed when Rails is restarted, had to restart
memcached on my laptop using:

  launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.memcached.plist
  launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.memcached.plist


----[ Tuesday, January 20, 2009 ]-------------------------------------

@ Installed memcached on my MacBook Pro using:

  # port install memcached

which installed the program and gave the following error message:

  ###########################################################
  # A startup item has been generated that will aid in
  # starting memcached with launchd. It is disabled
  # by default. Execute the following command to start it,
  # and to cause it to launch at startup:
  #
  # sudo launchctl load -w
  # /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.memcached.plist
  ###########################################################

Ran the command to have memcached start with launchd.

Installed the memcache-client gem:

  # gem install memcache-client

Changed the cache_store line in config/environment.rb to:

  ActionController::Base.cache_store = :mem_cache_store

Then modified config/environments/development.rb to enable caching for
the development environment:

  config.action_controller.perform_caching             = true


----[ Saturday, January 17, 2009 ]------------------------------------

@ Checked the contactimprov.net SPF record using:

  http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html


----[ Thursday, January 15, 2009 ]------------------------------------

@ THE BIG SERVER SWITCH!

ContactImprov.net goes live on my server.


----[ Sunday, January 4, 2009 ]---------------------------------------

@ Installed the sanitize gem on my laptop.


----[ Saturday, January 3, 2009 ]-------------------------------------

@ Downloaded ContactImprov.net website using SiteSucker:

  http://www.sitesucker.us/home.html

@ Tried deploying the application to craigharman.net.

Updated rubygems from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1.

While running 'gem update', also updated Passenger from 2.0.5 to
2.0.6.  Ran the program:

  passenger-install-apache2-module

to compile a new Apache module for Passenger.  Updated httpd.conf.
Stopped Apache, then started it.

I try to access the website, but get a Passenger error page with the
error message:

  No such file or directory - /nonexistent

Found this post clamining that the error message was caused by a bugy
in RubyGems 1.3:

  http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/browse_thread/thread/dbb6711f24471527

The solution is apparently to make certain that environment.rb is now
owned by 'nobody' or 'root'.

Changed the owner of config/environment.rb to 'charman'.  I was then
able to access static pages, but got blank pages when trying to access
Rails actions, with this error message in the Apache logs:

  Error during failsafe response: Broken pipe
  (originally Broken pipe)
  [Sat Jan 03 21:36:46 2009] [error] [client 67.240.191.112] Premature end of script headers: 

I deleted the existing log files, and Rails then created new ones -
this time, owned by 'charman'.



----[ Tuesday, December 16, 2008 ]------------------------------------

@ Created Rails project, imported into Subversion.

@ I want to share some code between the ci_rails and cq_rails
projects.

I looked at the documentation for svn:externals:

  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.externals.html

and then issued the following command:

  svn propedit svn:externals vendor/plugins

which opened up a text editor, where I added this line:

  acts_as_state_machine https://craigharman.net/svn/cq_rails/vendor/plugins/acts_as_state_machine

Subversion 1.5 supports a different syntax for svn:externals
properties, but Leopard still ships with Subversion 1.4, so I'm
currently sticking with the older syntax.

@ Took a quick look around for Rails date/time pickers.  There is an
amazing one hosted here:

  http://code.google.com/p/calendardateselect/

which can be installed using:

  gem install calendar_date_select
