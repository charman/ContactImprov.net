@ Checked the contactimprov.net SPF record using:

  http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html


----[ Thursday, January 15, 2009 ]------------------------------------

@ THE BIG SERVER SWITCH!

ContactImprov.net goes live on my server.


----[ Sunday, January 4, 2009 ]---------------------------------------

@ Installed the sanitize gem on my laptop.


----[ Saturday, January 3, 2009 ]-------------------------------------

@ Downloaded ContactImprov.net website using SiteSucker:

  http://www.sitesucker.us/home.html

@ Tried deploying the application to craigharman.net.

Updated rubygems from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1.

While running 'gem update', also updated Passenger from 2.0.5 to
2.0.6.  Ran the program:

  passenger-install-apache2-module

to compile a new Apache module for Passenger.  Updated httpd.conf.
Stopped Apache, then started it.

I try to access the website, but get a Passenger error page with the
error message:

  No such file or directory - /nonexistent

Found this post clamining that the error message was caused by a bugy
in RubyGems 1.3:

  http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/browse_thread/thread/dbb6711f24471527

The solution is apparently to make certain that environment.rb is now
owned by 'nobody' or 'root'.

Changed the owner of config/environment.rb to 'charman'.  I was then
able to access static pages, but got blank pages when trying to access
Rails actions, with this error message in the Apache logs:

  Error during failsafe response: Broken pipe
  (originally Broken pipe)
  [Sat Jan 03 21:36:46 2009] [error] [client 67.240.191.112] Premature end of script headers: 

I deleted the existing log files, and Rails then created new ones -
this time, owned by 'charman'.



----[ Tuesday, December 16, 2008 ]------------------------------------

@ Created Rails project, imported into Subversion.

@ I want to share some code between the ci_rails and cq_rails
projects.

I looked at the documentation for svn:externals:

  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.externals.html

and then issued the following command:

  svn propedit svn:externals vendor/plugins

which opened up a text editor, where I added this line:

  acts_as_state_machine https://craigharman.net/svn/cq_rails/vendor/plugins/acts_as_state_machine

Subversion 1.5 supports a different syntax for svn:externals
properties, but Leopard still ships with Subversion 1.4, so I'm
currently sticking with the older syntax.

@ Took a quick look around for Rails date/time pickers.  There is an
amazing one hosted here:

  http://code.google.com/p/calendardateselect/

which can be installed using:

  gem install calendar_date_select
