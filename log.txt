----[ Saturday, January 3, 2009 ]-------------------------------------

@ Downloaded ContactImprov.net website using SiteSucker:

  http://www.sitesucker.us/home.html


----[ Tuesday, December 16, 2008 ]------------------------------------

@ Created Rails project, imported into Subversion.

@ I want to share some code between the ci_rails and cq_rails
projects.

I looked at the documentation for svn:externals:

  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.externals.html

and then issued the following command:

  svn propedit svn:externals vendor/plugins

which opened up a text editor, where I added this line:

  acts_as_state_machine https://craigharman.net/svn/cq_rails/vendor/plugins/acts_as_state_machine

Subversion 1.5 supports a different syntax for svn:externals
properties, but Leopard still ships with Subversion 1.4, so I'm
currently sticking with the older syntax.

@ Took a quick look around for Rails date/time pickers.  There is an
amazing one hosted here:

  http://code.google.com/p/calendardateselect/

which can be installed using:

  gem install calendar_date_select
